1
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:20,356
Come children. On
your way to school.

2
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,592
- Good morning mother Goose.
- Good morning.

3
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:37,575
Here you are, balloons.
All colors of the rainbow.

4
00:06:10,524 --> 00:06:13,207
Boys! Boys!

5
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,131
Oh these kids will
be the death of me.

6
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:14,224
Bo Peep.

7
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,617
I'm coming mother.

8
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,497
Oh you children will
be the death of me.

9
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,887
Ah, mother, do you
really mean that?

10
00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:24,277
Of course I don't.

11
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:29,549
Now you run right along
and tend to your sheep.

12
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,732
And don't go
losing them again.

13
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,128
I won't.

14
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:38,404
Come on fleecy, come
on curly, come on wooly.

15
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,862
How do you do my
dear Sra. Peep.

16
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:48,955
How do you do, Sr. Barnaby?

17
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:50,946
And how is your charming
daughter, Ms. Bo Peep?

18
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,439
Very well thank you.

19
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,024
Then, may I be permitted
to pay my respects?

20
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:01,297
Sorry, but she's out
tending her sheep.

21
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:03,985
Thank you.

22
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,463
Thank you.

23
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,612
Good morning my pretty
little butterfly.

24
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,595
Good morning Sr. Barnaby!

25
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:24,185
I bring you a little bouquet

26
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:27,171
A fragrant token
of my deep devotion.

27
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,853
Thank you very
much Sr. Barnaby.

28
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:34,434
And now I have to leave
you sir. My my sheep

29
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:36,624
Nay!

30
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,014
I have long admired you.

31
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:42,898
Deep with wonder on your
sweet and maidenly virtue.

32
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:46,483
Marveled at your
tender loveliness.

33
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,477
In short

34
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:51,063
I'm asking you
to become my wife.

35
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,153
I

36
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:54,450
I'm sorry Sr. Barnaby

37
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,441
and I hope you won't
think me ungrateful

38
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,830
- but
- I'm a very rich man my dear.

39
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,524
Please!

40
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:02,712
Think carefully, child.

41
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:05,300
Lest I revert
to other means.

42
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:08,188
That would be an ugly
way to win a pretty wife.

43
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:11,374
I wouldn't marry you if you
were young, which you can't be

44
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,566
if you were honest,
which you never were

45
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:17,052
and if you were about to die tomorrow
which is too much to hope for.

46
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:20,039
We shall meet again my
pretty little buttercup.

47
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,424
And then you will
sing a different tune.

48
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:39,646
Fleecy, Curly!

49
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,506
I came back to remind you that
your little financial obligation

50
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:48,503
You mean the mortgage?

51
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,097
is due today.

52
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,685
Couldn't you give me
just a little more time?

53
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:56,271
I'm sorry. The law
must take it's course.

54
00:09:56,272 --> 00:10:00,748
I shall be back shortly.

55
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:10,199
Come boys.

56
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:11,694
You'll be late for work.

57
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,089
We're coming.

58
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:17,068
Good morning, mother Peep.

59
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:18,462
Good morning, Ollie!

60
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:22,142
Will you come on.
It's almost 8 O'clock.

61
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,374
Why, I thought I left you
upstairs in the bedroom.

62
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,570
You did.

63
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:37,965
Well how'd you
get down here?

64
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:39,858
I fell out the window.

65
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,949
Good morning mother Peep.

66
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,946
God morgen Stannie.

67
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:42,943
Good morning Ollie.

68
00:10:42,944 --> 00:10:45,332
God morgen Stan never
mind good morning.

69
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:46,429
Come on and let's go!

70
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,818
Wait a minute. I
forgot something.

71
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,311
I'll be right down.

72
00:10:52,503 --> 00:10:55,385
Will you come on. Do you
want us to be late for work?

73
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:57,677
Don't forget
your lunch, Ollie.

74
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:00,857
What's the matter,
mother Peep?

75
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:03,548
I've got bad news for you.

76
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:04,842
Bad news?!

77
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:08,726
I'm afraid you two boys will have
to find some other place to live.

78
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:11,112
Well what do you mean?

79
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,392
That old stingely Barnaby holds
the mortgage against this shoe.

80
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:16,987
It's due today

81
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:18,280
and I haven't got
the money to pay him.

82
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:21,667
And we'll all be cast
out into the street.

83
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,352
Stannie. Go upstairs
and get my money box.

84
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:26,349
Eh?

85
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,738
Go get my money box.

86
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,921
What are you going to do?

87
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:34,211
I'm going to give
you all of my savings.

88
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,796
And I'll get the rest of it
from our master the toy maker.

89
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,584
No ones going to throw
you out of this shoe.

90
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:42,173
Oh I can't let you
do such a thing.

91
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,339
Tut, tut, tut, tarut!

92
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:48,741
One good turn
deserves another.

93
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,832
Now smile!

94
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:55,307
That's it that's it.

95
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:09,540
I owe you 1.48. Stannie Dum

96
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:11,732
I borrowed it.

97
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,125
I know you borrowed it.

98
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:16,607
But what did you
borrow it for?!

99
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,399
Well you see I had to
buy some more Pee wee's.

100
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,585
I lost three of them playing
with little Jack Horner.

101
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:24,373
Had to buy some
more Pee Wee's.

102
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,955
Well don't you
mind, Mother Peep

103
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,244
I'll get the full amount
from the toy maker.

104
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:33,232
Oh you boys musn't go
into debt on my account.

105
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:36,718
Listen, when the toy maker finds out
that Barnaby's up to his old tricks again

106
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:39,904
he'll give me the full
amount without any problem.

107
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,390
Oh, can I depend on that?

108
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:44,579
Why of course you can.

109
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,465
You know the toy maker
and I are just like that.

110
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,352
Aren't we, Stannie?

111
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:51,946
Are you?

112
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:53,141
Why certainly.

113
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:53,341
Hvem af jer?

114
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:56,727
- Which is you?
- Why this one right never mind!

115
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,917
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

116
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't forget your lunch.

117
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,693
And don't you worry.

118
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:05,288
No I won't.

119
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,378
Good bye boys.

120
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:11,611
Just a moment.

121
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:15,660
What is this Pee Wee business
you've been spending all my money on?

122
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:16,956
Would you like to see it?

123
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:19,742
Certainly I'd like to see it.
After all the money it's cost me

124
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,808
I think I'm entitled to
know what it's all about.

125
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:23,227
Alright, look.

126
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,230
What do you think of that?

127
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,504
Piffle!

128
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:42,286
That's the silliest
thing I have ever seen.

129
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:43,141
Try it.

130
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:45,256
I don't want to try it!

131
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:46,900
Why, can't you do it?

132
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,475
Well certainly I can. What
do you mean, can't I do it

133
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:50,998
Give me that!
Get over there.

134
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:56,756
It's a certainty that
anything you can do I can do!

135
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:02,597
What for instance?

136
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:46,203
Here!

137
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:14,630
Just a moment!

138
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:26,432
Thank you!

139
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,502
Come on, we'll
be late for work.

140
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:45,131
Say listen when you
get that money from the

141
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:48,020
toy maker will you borrow
a little extra for me?

142
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,692
Well I lost me Pee Wee and
I'll have to get some more.

143
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:51,784
Get in here now,
will you. Pee Wee!

144
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:08,801
Good morning, master.

145
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,593
What do you mean,
good morning?!

146
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,783
You know you're
half an hour late!

147
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:15,174
If this happens again, it
will mean instant dismissal.

148
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:17,266
Get to work!

149
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,090
Say, aren't you gonna ask him about
the money to pay off the mortgage?

150
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:35,877
I can't ask him now. Don't you
see what a bad humor he's in.

151
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:38,956
Well if we don't get that
money, Mother Peep's gonna be

152
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,252
turned out of the shoe and she
won't have any place to sleep.

153
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:43,645
We can't let her do that.

154
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:47,328
Why if I ask him now, he'll
jump right down my throat.

155
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,507
But I thought you and
he were just like that.

156
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:52,802
We are!

157
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,197
Well why don't you ask him?

158
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:56,882
Why don't you ask him?

159
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,873
Well I can't ask him.

160
00:16:58,874 --> 00:16:59,871
Why?

161
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:02,857
Well he and I are
just like that.

162
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:04,251
Oh, don't be silly.

163
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,138
He likes you better
than he does me.

164
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,137
Does he?

165
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:10,826
Yep. He told me he did!

166
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:13,015
- Did he?
- Yeah!

167
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:15,700
Oh master.

168
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,997
What?

169
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:18,987
Ollie wants to speak to you.

170
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:21,971
Well, what is it?

171
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:24,758
Well could I speak to
you privately please sir?

172
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:27,842
I've got a very important
question I want to ask you.

173
00:17:27,843 --> 00:17:28,838
Don't bother me now!

174
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,029
Can't you see that I'm
busy?! Go on with your work!

175
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:36,804
Well if you knew how important it
was, you'd see me privately because if

176
00:17:37,204 --> 00:17:40,186
Will you shut up and
go on with your work!

177
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:54,419
Fleecy fleecy!

178
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:57,031
Wooly snowball?!

179
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:02,328
No, I haven't seen them!

180
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,633
Oh, Tom Tom.

181
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:35,223
I don't know what mother would
do if they were really lost.

182
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:37,812
Oh, don't worry.
They'll be found.

183
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:39,904
You've lost them
before, haven't you?

184
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:43,985
Matter of fact, last month
you lost them five times!

185
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:45,679
Oh I couldn't have.

186
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,676
Yes you did.

187
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,171
And four times the
month before that!

188
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:50,959
You see, you're
getting worse.

189
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:55,438
What you need is someone to help
you look after the darn things.

190
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,729
Who, for instance?

191
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:01,214
Oh, he'd have to
be most unusual.

192
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,405
Energetic resourceful

193
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:05,896
and with any
amount of patience.

194
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,272
A fellow sort of well

195
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:12,661
Like me!

196
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:17,438
Not interested?

197
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,827
Not even a little bit?

198
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:33,358
Then I'll just keep you there
until you are interested!

199
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,923
- Nice? Interested?
- Uh huh.

200
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,046
Oh look Tom Tom,
they found them!

201
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,318
You should hang your
head you naughty sheep.

202
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:56,755
My dear friends

203
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:59,147
and citizens of Toyland.

204
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,038
I want you all to meet

205
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:04,025
The future Sra. Piper!

206
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,765
Hello mister toy maker.

207
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:24,554
Well, how's my
order coming along?

208
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,744
Everything is in fine shape.

209
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:28,339
- Good.
- Are you coming in?

210
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,932
Yes, just a moment.

211
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:36,867
Alright. I won't forget
you. Now run along.

212
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:48,241
Hello everybody.
How's everything?

213
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:50,233
And how are my two boys?

214
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,925
Hello Sr. Santee.

215
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:56,503
Can't wait until you see the
wooden soldiers we made for you.

216
00:26:56,504 --> 00:26:59,390
The finest piece of work
we've ever turned out.

217
00:26:59,391 --> 00:27:00,385
Splendid!

218
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,980
Ollie! Go and bring
one of them in.

219
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:04,070
Yes sir. You'd better
help me. They're heavy.

220
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:06,261
We'll have them
right out, Sr. Santee.

221
00:27:07,658 --> 00:27:10,540
You'll get the
surprise of your life!

222
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:19,994
Don't try to lift it. All you have
to do is press the button in the back

223
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:21,885
And it walks out by itself.

224
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,591
Isn't it wonderful?

225
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:44,080
It does everything but talk.

226
00:27:45,476 --> 00:27:47,562
Wonderful yes. But
not what I ordered.

227
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,553
What do you mean?

228
00:27:50,153 --> 00:27:53,538
I ordered 600 soldiers
at one foot high.

229
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:55,330
What?

230
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:03,190
You took that order.

231
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:04,187
What was it?

232
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:07,573
I thought you said 100
soldiers at six foot high.

233
00:28:09,962 --> 00:28:11,750
You got the order all wrong.

234
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:16,131
I couldn't give those things
to my children to play with.

235
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:22,498
Put it back in the box and get
out of here. You're through!

236
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:29,762
Here's another mess
you've gotten us into.

237
00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:32,646
Well I couldn't help it.

238
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:35,933
If you had been watching what you were
doing, you wouldn't have gotten us into

239
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:38,920
Come out of there.
Not you! It's for him!

240
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:46,183
Put that thing back in
the box! Get out of here!

241
00:28:54,347 --> 00:28:57,523
Stop it! Stop
it! Do something!

242
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:23,003
Come out of there!

243
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:25,690
Why didn't you stop it,
you blithering idiots?!

244
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:27,681
Now get out and stay out!

245
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:28,678
Yes sir.

246
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:33,452
Aren't you gonna ask him about
the money for the mortgage?

247
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,046
What's that?!

248
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:38,530
Just skip it. It's a fine
time to ask for money.

249
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:44,201
Oh mommy. I'm so happy!

250
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:46,492
Tom Tom has asked me
to become his bride.

251
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,580
My child.

252
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:50,472
And with your permission,
we'd like to be married.

253
00:29:50,473 --> 00:29:52,463
Why of course darling.

254
00:29:52,464 --> 00:29:54,853
My blessings are with you.

255
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:57,841
And may nothing ever happen
to mar your happiness.

256
00:29:57,843 --> 00:29:59,337
Ah, thank you mother.

257
00:30:01,825 --> 00:30:03,214
Sr. Barnaby!

258
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:05,805
When you enter my house,
I'll trouble you to knock.

259
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,198
Your house, my good lady?

260
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:09,887
Did you say your house?

261
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:11,382
Yes, my house!

262
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:14,467
Not until this little
debt is fulfilled.

263
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:16,460
Why mother, what
does it mean?

264
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:18,351
It means my dear

265
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:20,543
that unless this
mortgage is paid

266
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:23,430
You will all be thrown
out into the street.

267
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:25,124
Of course

268
00:30:26,518 --> 00:30:28,906
We could compromise.

269
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,502
Compromise?

270
00:30:30,503 --> 00:30:31,498
Yes.

271
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:34,484
Should your daughter
reconsider my generous offer

272
00:30:34,485 --> 00:30:35,780
to become my wife

273
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,866
we could forget
this little matter.

274
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:41,855
And it could be
her wedding present.

275
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:42,453
Mother?!

276
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:46,833
Don't worry darling nothing
like that will ever happen.

277
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:51,111
Then, let us get
down to business.

278
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:06,934
Sr. Barnaby!

279
00:31:06,935 --> 00:31:07,931
You can make
out your receipt.

280
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,819
You'll be paid in
full, right now!

281
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,683
Well, here you are boys.

282
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:19,079
Just in time.

283
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:25,747
This wretched man seems to think that we
haven't got the money to pay off the mortgage.

284
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:28,628
But we have, haven't we!

285
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:31,020
Haven't we boys!

286
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:34,802
Why what's the matter?

287
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,392
Didn't you get the money?

288
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:39,782
No, you see Ollie
made a mistake.

289
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,372
A mistake?

290
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:44,060
He and the toy maker
are not like that.

291
00:31:44,061 --> 00:31:45,455
Are you!?

292
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:49,437
Then I take it madam

293
00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:53,317
You cannot meet your
lawful obligation?

294
00:31:53,318 --> 00:31:55,407
In which case, I
shall bid you good day.

295
00:31:55,408 --> 00:31:59,292
Foreclosure papers will
be served in due course.

296
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:02,677
Oh, your not really going
to throw us into the street?

297
00:32:03,274 --> 00:32:05,565
Much as it pains
me, I'm sorry.

298
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:16,811
Big bait catches big rats!

299
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:21,884
Oh mother, what shall I do?

300
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:24,672
If only he didn't
have that mortgage.

301
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,365
Don't you worry, Mother Peep

302
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:30,248
Stannie and me will find a way to get
the mortgage from that old buzzard!

303
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,538
He sure is an old buzzard.

304
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,720
You know, if he thinks he's gonna throw
this shoe into the street, he's mistaken.

305
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:37,717
He certainly is.

306
00:32:37,718 --> 00:32:39,212
You know what
I'd like to do.

307
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:40,206
What?

308
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:43,094
I'd like to put on this shoe
and kick him right in the pants.

309
00:32:46,081 --> 00:32:48,368
Then I'd kick

310
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,736
What happened?

311
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:56,429
Barnaby clunked you.

312
00:33:02,204 --> 00:33:03,791
Open that window.

313
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:20,636
- Ollie?
- What?

314
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:22,231
We're outside.

315
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,226
Good!

316
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:24,621
Now what do we do?

317
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:28,206
Take me over to Barnaby's house
and be sure no one sees you.

318
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:29,600
Ok.

319
00:34:31,094 --> 00:34:33,579
And be careful!

320
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:53,485
We're here.

321
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:55,675
So far, so good.

322
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,672
It wasn't so far.

323
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:58,166
We just came
across the street.

324
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,860
Ring the bell!

325
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:02,648
It wasn't so far! Hmph!

326
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:16,381
Who is it?

327
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:17,676
It's me.

328
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:20,165
What do you want at
this hour of the night?

329
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:24,049
Well you see, Ollie and I are sorry
for what happened this afternoon

330
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:28,628
And just to show you we're not mad at
you, we brought you a Christmas present.

331
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:30,720
It's from me,
and from Ollie.

332
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,505
Christmas present

333
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,201
in the middle of July?

334
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:37,789
Oh yes, you see we always do
our Christmas shopping early.

335
00:35:38,987 --> 00:35:41,372
If you'll open the door I'll
bring it right in for you.

336
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,363
I'll be right down.

337
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:51,917
He's coming down. He's
going to let us in.

338
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:53,113
That's fine.

339
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:54,207
Now don't forget

340
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,504
when he goes to bed

341
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:56,899
you give me the signal.

342
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,582
And I'll get out of the box,
open the door and let you in.

343
00:36:01,181 --> 00:36:03,469
Then we'll get the mortgage.

344
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,649
So far, so good.

345
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:41,988
Ah, what is it?

346
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:45,371
- I couldn't tell you.
- Couldn't?

347
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:47,305
No. You see it's a surprise.

348
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,958
And it musn't be
opened til Christmas.

349
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:50,653
See.

350
00:36:50,654 --> 00:36:53,242
Do not open,
until Christmas.

351
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:57,219
Well, that's
very nice of you.

352
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,113
It is, isn't it!

353
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:01,896
Well, good night
Sr. Barnaby.

354
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:03,489
Good night Sr. Dum.

355
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:08,663
You can go to bed now.

356
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,354
Thank you

357
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,348
Sr.

358
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:12,744
Dum.

359
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,537
Merry Christmas.

360
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:16,529
A merry Christmas to you.

361
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,612
Good night.

362
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:20,508
Good night!

363
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:21,904
Good night Ollie!

364
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,297
Good night Stannie!

365
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:03,908
Where as Ollie Dee and Stannie Dum
have been found guilty of burglary

366
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:09,084
they will be dunked and thereafter
exiled to bogey land forever!

367
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:15,353
Good night Ollie!

368
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:21,123
Your majesty what
are we waiting for?

369
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:25,898
Oh yeah proceed
with the dunking!

370
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:36,051
Come on!

371
00:38:37,544 --> 00:38:40,326
Your first. Come on!

372
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:44,605
- Ollie!
- What?

373
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:49,877
You better give me your watch. I'll
hold it for you until you come out.

374
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:55,647
Thanks. Now take good care of it because
I wouldn't have anything happen to that.

375
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:57,638
- I will.
- Good bye.

376
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,035
Good bye.

377
00:38:59,433 --> 00:39:00,428
- Come on!
- All right.

378
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:06,696
Splendid!

379
00:39:24,914 --> 00:39:26,801
- Is it cold?
- Yes!

380
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:36,554
I'm smothering!

381
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:40,037
- Keep your nose closed!
- I will!

382
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,022
Hurry. He'll die of ammonia!

383
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,796
This is terrible.

384
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,050
Hold your nose, Ollie!

385
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:46,222
Bring him up.

386
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:56,572
How do you feel?

387
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,364
You know how I feel!

388
00:41:00,854 --> 00:41:03,636
Here, have a drink of
water. That'll do you good.

389
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:07,815
Haven't I had enough water?!

390
00:41:07,816 --> 00:41:09,707
I was only trying to help.

391
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:14,581
Sr. Barnaby. Can't something
be done to stop this?

392
00:41:14,582 --> 00:41:16,475
Why yes. Consent
to become my wife.

393
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,665
And they will go free.

394
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:24,536
All right, Sr. Barnaby.

395
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:26,827
I consent.

396
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:32,497
With your majesty's permission.
I wish to withdraw my charges.

397
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:34,190
Withdrawn they shall be.

398
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:38,169
Residents of Toyland

399
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,061
I want you all to meet

400
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:43,446
The future Senhora.
Silas Barnaby.

401
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:47,724
You may go.

402
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:48,720
Thank you sir.

403
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:50,912
- Does that mean we're free?
- Yes.

404
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:56,184
And from now on, you and I are
going to be very close friends.

405
00:41:57,577 --> 00:42:00,460
- Does that mean that he won't be dunked!?
- Yes!

406
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:03,145
- Isn't that nice?
- What?

407
00:42:03,544 --> 00:42:05,535
He and I are just like that.

408
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:06,931
And I don't have to get wet.

409
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:09,320
Oh, is that so!

410
00:42:19,177 --> 00:42:20,864
- Ollie!
- What?

411
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:22,260
Here's your watch.

412
00:42:30,821 --> 00:42:36,987
Run over and tell the bride that all is
in readyness and her lover is waiting.

413
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:49,129
Mumsy, what did Tom Tom say?

414
00:42:50,327 --> 00:42:51,616
He understands.

415
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:56,892
Now you see. If you hadn't said good
night Ollie, this wouldn't have happened.

416
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,469
Where are you
going Mother Peep?

417
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,356
I'm going over to Barnaby
to make a final plea.

418
00:43:04,357 --> 00:43:09,533
Surely there must be one spark of
kindness in that phony heart of his.

419
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:13,811
That's a good ideia. But I
don't think it will do any good.

420
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:22,269
You're right Ollie. You
can't turn blood into a stone.

421
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,556
What do you mean?

422
00:43:25,054 --> 00:43:25,750
What do you mean?

423
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:28,538
Well her talking to Barnaby

424
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:32,920
is just a matter of pouring one ear into
another and coming out the other side.

425
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:36,004
It can't be done.

426
00:43:37,098 --> 00:43:40,483
I'm sorry Bo Peep that you had
to choose me for the best man.

427
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:45,264
Why I'd rather do anything in this
world than to have to give you away.

428
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:50,536
Why Stannie is so upset, he's
not even going to the wedding.

429
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:53,419
You are upset, aren't you!

430
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,903
Upset?! I'm house broken.

431
00:43:57,999 --> 00:44:00,782
Not house broken.

432
00:44:00,783 --> 00:44:03,770
He means heart broken.

433
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:07,849
House broken huh!

434
00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:10,361
Come in.

435
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:20,527
Sr. Barnaby. Don't force my
daughter into this dreadful marriage.

436
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:23,869
I'm an old woman. Pleading
for her daughter's happiness.

437
00:44:25,265 --> 00:44:27,650
Oh don't do this
dreadful thing.

438
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:31,332
Sr. Barnaby. I'll
do anything you ask!

439
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,324
Work for you. Slave for you.

440
00:44:33,824 --> 00:44:36,709
Only don't please don't.

441
00:44:39,896 --> 00:44:42,083
Woman, you're a fool!

442
00:44:42,084 --> 00:44:45,069
The bargains made and
you'll abide by it.

443
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:49,346
Master, the bride is here!

444
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,162
Welcome to Barnaby Hall.

445
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,733
Shut that door!

446
00:45:15,323 --> 00:45:17,607
Come, come judge.
Let's waste no time.

447
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:19,003
Have you the ring?

448
00:45:20,895 --> 00:45:22,383
Your name is Silas Barnaby?

449
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:24,377
It is.

450
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:26,865
And your name is
Little Bo Peep?

451
00:45:26,866 --> 00:45:28,259
It is.

452
00:45:29,356 --> 00:45:31,840
Do you take this woman for
you lawfully wedded wife?

453
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,037
I do.

454
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,118
And do you take this man for
your lawfully wedded husband?

455
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:39,602
I do.

456
00:45:44,782 --> 00:45:49,157
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

457
00:45:51,746 --> 00:45:53,136
And now, to kiss the bride.

458
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:54,530
Just a moment.

459
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,912
Haven't you forgotten
something, Sr. Barnaby?

460
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:00,795
Oh yes. The mortgage.

461
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:05,074
My wedding present.

462
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:19,305
Now, you may kiss the bride.

463
00:46:25,876 --> 00:46:28,160
What is the
meaning of this?!

464
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:31,048
Big bait, catches big rats!

465
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:36,123
The king shall hear of this!

466
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:56,127
Tom Tom.

467
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:01,400
Oh my boys!

468
00:47:09,465 --> 00:47:10,953
That sure was a
good ideia of yours.

469
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:12,348
It certainly was!

470
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:13,942
Well good bye!

471
00:47:13,943 --> 00:47:16,034
And good luck.

472
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,817
What do you mean, good bye?

473
00:47:18,818 --> 00:47:20,311
Aren't I going with you?

474
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:21,309
Why no.

475
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,797
You have to stay
here with Barnaby.

476
00:47:23,798 --> 00:47:25,192
Your married to him.

477
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,844
I don't want to
stay here with him.

478
00:47:34,845 --> 00:47:36,240
Why?

479
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,231
I don't love him!

480
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:52,563
Well don't worry. Old Barnaby
will never bother us again.

481
00:47:53,857 --> 00:47:57,336
- Because I'm going to take you away.
- Where?

482
00:49:29,814 --> 00:49:34,289
Tricked! Cheated!
Laughed at in the streets!

483
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,182
Fools!

484
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:39,961
So they think they can
outwit old Barnaby, eh.

485
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:44,438
I'll show them.

486
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:48,714
There must be a way.

487
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:52,992
There must be some way!

488
00:49:56,776 --> 00:50:00,256
Idiot! Dolt! Imbecile! Pig!

489
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:05,269
Pig!

490
00:50:06,663 --> 00:50:10,940
Get me a nice red juicy apple. I'll
steal one of the three little pigs.

491
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:14,918
And the evidence will be
placed in Tom Tom's house.

492
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:18,304
You know the penalty
for pig-napping?

493
00:50:18,603 --> 00:50:21,187
Banishment to Bogeyland!

494
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:33,556
Sit still!

495
00:51:36,047 --> 00:51:38,829
Take this evidence and
place it in Tom Tom's house.

496
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:44,600
Master. Why the sausage?

497
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,692
That will prove that
he not only stole the

498
00:51:47,693 --> 00:51:51,071
pig, but that he also
ground him into sausage.

499
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:56,443
And now little Elmer

500
00:51:57,342 --> 00:51:58,734
We shall see.

501
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:21,909
Whereas Tom-Tom Piper has
been found guilty of pignapping

502
00:52:22,513 --> 00:52:26,389
He will be immediately
banished to Bogeyland.

503
00:52:28,483 --> 00:52:30,169
Poor Tom Tom.

504
00:52:30,568 --> 00:52:33,555
I'm sure glad we didn't
have to go to Bogeyland.

505
00:52:34,055 --> 00:52:35,543
So am I.

506
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:37,435
What happens to
you in Bogeyland?

507
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:39,826
Oh it's a terrible place.

508
00:52:39,926 --> 00:52:42,614
Once you go there,
you never come back.

509
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,099
Why?

510
00:52:45,101 --> 00:52:49,277
Well, when the Bogeyman
gets you, they eat you alive!

511
00:52:50,573 --> 00:52:52,164
What do they look like?

512
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:56,941
Well I've heard that they're
half man, and half animal.

513
00:52:58,434 --> 00:53:02,512
With great big ears
and great big mouths.

514
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:05,894
And hair all
over their body.

515
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:10,073
And long claws that
they catch you with.

516
00:53:14,356 --> 00:53:15,943
Scat! Go on!

517
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:21,320
Tom my boy you knew the penalty
for pinapping. Why did you do it?

518
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:22,517
But I didn't do it!

519
00:53:22,518 --> 00:53:24,906
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

520
00:53:24,907 --> 00:53:26,997
How can you say that

521
00:53:27,097 --> 00:53:30,084
in view of this evidence
found in your house.

522
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:33,567
Take it away.

523
00:53:34,563 --> 00:53:36,852
Your majesty. You made
a horrible mistake.

524
00:53:36,853 --> 00:53:39,342
Tom Tom knows
nothing about this.

525
00:53:39,343 --> 00:53:42,628
He's been with me all
day. Hasn't he mommy!

526
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:44,215
That's right your majesty.

527
00:53:44,316 --> 00:53:47,203
Why not let the law take
it's course, your majesty?!

528
00:53:58,154 --> 00:54:00,540
Watch that until
I come back!

529
00:54:26,024 --> 00:54:27,313
What does that mean?

530
00:54:27,314 --> 00:54:29,206
Exhibit B.

531
00:54:29,406 --> 00:54:32,789
That means that the pig
sausage is part of the evidence.

532
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:38,062
Doesn't taste like
pig sausage to me!

533
00:54:38,063 --> 00:54:39,956
What does it taste like?

534
00:54:40,555 --> 00:54:42,943
Tastes like pork.

535
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:49,210
Try it.

536
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,277
Why that's neither
pig nor pork!

537
00:54:56,278 --> 00:54:58,765
- It's beef!
- Beef?!

538
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:02,844
I smell a rat!

539
00:55:06,626 --> 00:55:09,111
Barnaby's got
a hand in that.

540
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,977
I believe that little
Elmer is still alive!

541
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:17,472
Come on, we'll find out!

542
00:55:17,473 --> 00:55:20,460
You've got to make them hear me
your majesty, you've got to hear.

543
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:23,740
Tom Tom knows
nothing about this.

544
00:55:23,741 --> 00:55:25,733
The little pigs
are friends of ours.

545
00:55:25,734 --> 00:55:27,724
Why should he
want to hurt them?

546
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:31,011
The violin and hat were in
the house when we got home.

547
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:34,887
He's innocent I
tell you, innocent!

548
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,959
It is with deep regret that I have
to enforce the law of our kingdom.

549
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,354
Take him away!

550
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:54,196
I tell you I'm innocent!
I tell you I'm innocent!

551
00:55:54,197 --> 00:55:55,589
- I didn't steal the pig!
- Tom Tom Tom Tom

552
00:56:36,604 --> 00:56:39,380
You see child it
was folly wasting

553
00:56:39,381 --> 00:56:42,473
your affections on
a common pignapper.

554
00:56:42,474 --> 00:56:44,459
Let me go! Let me go!

555
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,551
Tom Tom is innocent
and you know it!

556
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:48,245
I hate you! I hate you!

557
00:56:49,937 --> 00:56:52,720
Just a minute!
Just a minute!

558
00:56:55,309 --> 00:56:56,700
Silence!

559
00:56:57,398 --> 00:56:59,584
Sr. Majesty. Tom
Tom is innocent!

560
00:56:59,585 --> 00:57:02,968
We found little Elmer
in Barnaby's cellar!

561
00:57:04,364 --> 00:57:06,848
Let's get him!

562
00:57:19,393 --> 00:57:22,672
I'll give 50,000 Guineaus for the
capture of Barnaby dead or alive!

563
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:24,464
Dead or alive?!

564
00:57:24,764 --> 00:57:26,353
Dead or alive!

565
00:57:26,354 --> 00:57:29,737
Can't you make up your
mind which way you want him?

566
00:57:30,736 --> 00:57:32,423
Take me to my tower.

567
00:57:39,692 --> 00:57:42,674
Let's go around the
back way. We'll get him!

568
00:57:49,643 --> 00:57:51,825
Alright Sr. Barnaby.
There's no use hiding!

569
00:57:51,826 --> 00:57:53,917
We know where you are!

570
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:59,090
You better come out, because if you don't
we're gonna stay right here until you do.

571
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:01,873
Even if it takes all night!

572
00:58:02,671 --> 00:58:04,758
Are we gonna stay
here all night?

573
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:08,341
No! We're gonna make
him think we are.

574
00:58:15,012 --> 00:58:18,292
Tom Tom!

575
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,145
- Tom Tom!
- Bo Peep!

576
00:58:28,146 --> 00:58:31,132
Stan and Ollie found
little Elmer, alive!

577
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,129
Where?

578
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,524
In Barnaby's cellar.

579
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,404
I knew he had something
to do with this!

580
00:58:37,405 --> 00:58:38,797
Oh if I ever get
my hands on him.

581
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,075
Come on. We'll find
our way out of here.

582
00:58:48,053 --> 00:58:50,138
Oh Tom Tom, we'll never
find our way out of here!

583
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:52,826
Oh yes we will! Come on!

584
01:01:53,896 --> 01:01:56,183
- Did he come up?
- No!

585
01:01:56,184 --> 01:01:57,775
Are you coming up?

586
01:01:58,572 --> 01:02:00,658
You better come
up, dead or alive!

587
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:04,045
How can he come up
dead when he's alive?

588
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:08,919
Let's drop a rock on him, then
we'll make him dead when he's alive.

589
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,806
Now your talking sense.

590
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:18,674
- Look out!
- Don't tell him to look out!

591
01:02:18,675 --> 01:02:20,665
- It might have hit him.
- That's what I wanted to do!

592
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,061
Did it hit you?

593
01:02:23,754 --> 01:02:26,735
- Not a sound.
- It must have got him.

594
01:02:26,736 --> 01:02:28,031
Go down and bring him up.

595
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:30,521
You go down and
bring him up.

596
01:02:30,821 --> 01:02:36,992
Do you mean to tell me that you're going to
let 50,000 Guineas slip right thru your fingers?

597
01:02:36,993 --> 01:02:38,581
Well I'm scared!

598
01:02:38,582 --> 01:02:40,473
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

599
01:02:40,873 --> 01:02:42,760
You and he are
just like that!

600
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:46,341
Well that was before
we were married.

601
01:02:47,238 --> 01:02:50,819
All right. I'll compromise.
We'll both go down.

602
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,212
That's better.

603
01:02:52,213 --> 01:02:53,608
Go ahead.

604
01:03:03,761 --> 01:03:06,444
Wait a minute go ahead!

605
01:03:58,092 --> 01:04:02,771
I'll teach you to trifle
with Barnaby Silas!

606
01:04:48,577 --> 01:04:49,766
- You know what?
- What?

607
01:04:49,767 --> 01:04:50,764
He's not here.

608
01:04:50,765 --> 01:04:52,854
I can see he's not here!

609
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:55,042
Oh look! Maybe he
went through this way.

610
01:04:55,043 --> 01:04:57,431
I'll bet he did.
Let's go see.

611
01:05:19,133 --> 01:05:20,323
I wonder where he went?

612
01:05:20,324 --> 01:05:24,306
We'll soon find out.
Let's go that way.

613
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,329
There he is!

614
01:06:09,895 --> 01:06:12,578
Sr. Barnaby! You're
going back with us

615
01:06:13,575 --> 01:06:16,856
Oh the Bogeymen!

616
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:58,070
I can't get help! help!

617
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,702
They've escaped me.

618
01:07:12,703 --> 01:07:16,308
But I'll get them if I have
to destroy all of Toyland!

619
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:18,801
To the rafts!

620
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:49,133
Stand back! Here
comes the king.

621
01:07:50,829 --> 01:07:52,318
Why all the commotion!?

622
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,011
Have you no reverence
for my beauty sleep?!

623
01:07:54,012 --> 01:07:56,528
Sorry your majesty but
we were celebrating the

624
01:07:56,529 --> 01:07:58,990
rescue of Tom Tom and
Bo Peep from Bogeyland.

625
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,080
Splendid news!

626
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,074
And who had the
courage to do this?

627
01:08:03,075 --> 01:08:04,467
They did sir.

628
01:08:06,259 --> 01:08:07,649
Did you get Barnaby?

629
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,633
No sir! He was running so
fast, we couldn't catch him.

630
01:08:12,727 --> 01:08:14,119
- He was scared to
death, wasn't he?

631
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,214
He sure was!

632
01:08:15,313 --> 01:08:16,709
Well tell me all about it.

633
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,511
Stannie and me
chased Barnaby and the

634
01:08:32,513 --> 01:08:35,921
Bogeyman so far
they'll never come back!

635
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:44,274
What do these
Bogeyman look like?

636
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:47,756
Oh they're terrible looking!

637
01:08:47,758 --> 01:08:50,145
They're half man
and half animal!

638
01:08:51,242 --> 01:08:53,828
With great big ears

639
01:08:55,822 --> 01:08:58,008
great big mouths

640
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:00,298
and long claws

641
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:09,752
- Come back!
- You don't have to run away!

642
01:09:09,776 --> 01:09:12,165
- Nothing to be afraid of!
- You're not scared now!

643
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:15,323
They're not half
as bad as they look!

644
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:16,719
There they are!

645
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,201
Follow me!

646
01:09:36,725 --> 01:09:38,412
Break in the door!

647
01:10:29,379 --> 01:10:30,769
- Here!
- What are you going to do?

648
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:33,159
We'll fix those
Bogeymen! Come on!

649
01:10:40,327 --> 01:10:44,106
Come on now!

650
01:12:36,202 --> 01:12:38,229
- Say, you know what!
- What?

651
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:41,300
- Let's load them in the cannon!
- Fine!

652
01:13:24,073 --> 01:13:25,960
Get some more darts!

653
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:34,818
- You know what!
- What?

654
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:36,211
The wooden soldiers!

655
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:51,232
Let's get the cannon and
give them a parting shot!
