1
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:43,185
Our state fair is a
great state fair

2
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:47,106
Don't miss it
Don't even be late

3
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,027
It's dollars to doughnuts
that our state fair

4
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:55,529
Is the best state fair in our state

5
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,125
Our state fair is a
great state fair

6
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,212
Don't miss it
Don't even be late

7
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,883
It's dollars to doughnuts
that our state fair

8
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:18,385
Is the best state fair in our state

9
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,066
Take it easy, Blue Boy. Your
supper will be here any minute.

10
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,611
I wish I knew what was
keeping that feller.

11
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,240
Our state fair is a
great state fair

12
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:42,328
Don't miss it
Don't even be late

13
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,082
It's dollars to doughnuts
that our state fair

14
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:50,753
Is the best state fair in our state

15
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:55,424
Dad! Daddy, I just had
Mr. Cramer on the phone.

16
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,094
He said Dave Miller stopped
by his place 10 minutes ago

17
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,514
- to put water in his radiator.
- Thanks, daughter.

18
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,474
Margy?

19
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,437
- Have you finished your packing?
- Not yet. I was just going to.

20
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,941
I don't know what's got into you lately.
All you do is sit around and mope.

21
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,734
I don't sit around and mope.

22
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,939
Well, stop moping now and
finish your packing.

23
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,621
Always saying she doesn't
know what's got into me.

24
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,082
I'll be glad to get to the fair,

25
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,754
hear something different, see
something different for a change.

26
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,565
What has got into me, anyway?

27
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,219
The things I used to like

28
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,306
I don't like anymore

29
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,058
I want a lot of other things

30
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,520
I've never had before

31
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:36,484
It's just like Mother says

32
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:40,565
I sit around and mope

33
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:47,578
Pretending I am wonderful

34
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,330
And knowing I'm a dope

35
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,379
- Margy?
- Yes, Mother?

36
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,781
As soon as you're finished, I want you to
come down and help me with the pickles.

37
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,385
In a minute, Mother.

38
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,088
Pickles!

39
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,642
I'm as restless as a willow

40
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,436
In a windstorm

41
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,648
I'm as jumpy as a puppet

42
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,317
On a string

43
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:24,073
I'd say that I had spring fever

44
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:30,162
But I know it isn't spring

45
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:36,293
I'm starry-eyed and
vaguely discontented

46
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:42,424
Like a nightingale
without a song to sing

47
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:48,430
Oh, why should I have spring fever

48
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:55,020
When it isn't even spring

49
00:05:55,021 --> 00:06:00,818
I keep wishing
I were somewhere else

50
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:06,740
Walking down a strange, new street

51
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:12,788
Hearing words that
I have never heard

52
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:19,838
From a man I've yet to meet

53
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,841
I'm as busy as a spider

54
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,677
Spinning daydreams

55
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:32,641
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

56
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:38,314
I haven't seen a
crocus or a rosebud

57
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:44,028
Ora robin on the wing

58
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:48,282
But I feel so gay

59
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:52,328
In a melancholy way

60
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:59,378
That it might as well be spring

61
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:06,886
It might as well be

62
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,426
Spring

63
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,139
Margy!

64
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,232
I'm coming, Mother.

65
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,153
Come on, boy.

66
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,617
Ah, he'll win first this year sure.

67
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,786
He's half again the hog
he was last year.

68
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,707
You don't really expect to win, do
you, with that animated lard can?

69
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,752
Say, listen, you can say
anything you please about me,

70
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,463
but don't say anything bad
about Blue Boy.

71
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,716
That's the finest Hampshire
boar that ever breathed.

72
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,921
If you think that, he's
just as good as beat now.

73
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,888
Be better if he was
third or fourth best.

74
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,975
- He'd stand a better chance.
- What are you talking about?

75
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:01,063
If a hog or a man ever got what
he was entitled to just once,

76
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,024
the eternal stars would quit
making melody in the spheres.

77
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,361
Oh, there you go
with that book talk again.

78
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:11,031
I say he's the best hog in the state,
and the judges will say so too.

79
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,951
They might.
But if that turns out good,

80
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,578
then something else
will probably happen.

81
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,664
- He might catch pneumonia...
- Oh!

82
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,458
or hog cholera,
or you might catch pneumonia.

83
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,085
Or something might happen
to Wayne or Margy.

84
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,294
Oh!

85
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,881
Mark my words, Abel, there's
compensation in this world.

86
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,594
For every good, there's bad. Now,
Ralph Waldo Emerson tells us...

87
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,931
I don't care what
Waldo Emerson tells us!

88
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,350
Look, I'll just make
a little bet with you.

89
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,894
- On what?
- I'll bet you we go to the fair...

90
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,313
and Blue Boy
will win the grand award.

91
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,942
And nothing bad will happen
to him, me or my family.

92
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,153
Yes, and we'll all have
a good time too

93
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,780
and be better off for it
after the fair is over.

94
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:56,368
It's a foolish bet, Abel. If you'd
asked me, I'd have given you 10-to-1.

95
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,996
But you didn't ask me,
so it's an even bet.

96
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:03,418
- Five dollars?
- Five dollars is right.

97
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,962
I'll be around for the money
the day you get back.

98
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,466
- Be around with the money, you mean.
- You'll see. You'll see.

99
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,927
Yeah, I'll see.
Well, well, what's this?

100
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,764
You got your chains on.
You expecting a shower?

101
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,141
Nope. I'm expecting good weather.

102
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:23,017
That's why I put my chains on,
so I wouldn't be fooled.

103
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,487
Do you want your name "Mrs. Abel
Frake" or "Mrs. Melissa Frake"?

104
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,031
Melissa Frake, I guess. With
your father entering Blue Boy,

105
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,859
the judges might get us mixed.

106
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,995
Hog cholera, pneumonia.

107
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,998
He left out earthquakes,
the old gloom spreader.

108
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,247
Poor Dad.

109
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,713
Mmm, I don't know.

110
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,042
Let me taste.

111
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,055
- Don't taste like Grandma Stidger's.
- I followed her recipe.

112
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,268
- I'll get it.
- You left something out.

113
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,189
Abel Frake, I am not gonna
put liquor into my cooking!

114
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,234
Making mincemeat without brandy?
No such thing.

115
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,402
I don't approve of it,
and I won't do it.

116
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,280
Well, you'll be sorry. You know,
those judges at the fair,

117
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,199
they like a little snifter
now and then.

118
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,451
- It's Eleanor, for Wayne.
- Wayne's out back somewhere.

119
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,746
I'll find him.

120
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,710
Why don't you say hello
to Eleanor, Ma?

121
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,421
See how her mother is. You know, they
had the doctor again this morning.

122
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,466
- I suppose I should.
- Find out if she's going to the fair.

123
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,761
Yes, I will.

124
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,724
Hello, Eleanor. How are you, dear?

125
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,227
How's your mother feeling?

126
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:49,439
Yes, I know. I'm sorry I couldn't
get by to see her today,

127
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,315
but I've been so busy getting
ready to leave and all.

128
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,572
Oh, well, I'm glad
she's better, dear.

129
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,574
Wayne'll be here any moment.
Just hold on.

130
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,827
And be sure to give
my love to your mother.

131
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,872
Thank you, dear. Good-bye.

132
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,125
- Abel?
- Hmm?

133
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,336
I need a good-sized box, or cotton.
Something to carry my pickles in.

134
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,542
Know just what you want, Ma.
I'll get it for you right away.

135
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,686
"Stir in apples and molasses,
spices, lemons..."

136
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,766
"Two parts good brandy."

137
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,240
No, I won't!

138
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,117
- Eph, where's Wayne?
- Wayne? He's back there in the barn.

139
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,325
Thank you, mister.

140
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,460
And now, I think I'll have a
try at that fancy brass clock.

141
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,834
Yes, that one.

142
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,425
- There ya are.
- Wayne?

143
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,011
There's a nice string of pearls.
I think I'll have a go at them.

144
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,091
- Oh, I know they're fakes, but...
- Wayne!

145
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,226
What are you doing?

146
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,312
- How long you been there?
- Just a little while.

147
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,981
Why didn't you say somethin'
instead of just standing there?

148
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,566
Who were you talking to?

149
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,069
And does Mother know you have
her embroidery hoops out here?

150
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,240
Look, just leave me alone, will ya?
And stop prying in other people's affairs.

151
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,992
Speaking of affairs,
Eleanor's on the phone.

152
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,197
Eleanor? Well, Christmas!
Why didn't you tell me?

153
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,547
Eleanor's on the phone.

154
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:59,236
Hello, Eleanor? Hi, honey. What'd the
doctor say about your mother? Can you go?

155
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,488
Well, I don't know
what to do, Wayne.

156
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,615
The doctor said she's
a little better, but...

157
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,909
Oh, but, Eleanor, you've got to go!

158
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,331
I've made a lot
of plans for us. What?

159
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:34,563
I keep wishing
I were somewhere else

160
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:40,861
Walking down a strange, new street

161
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:46,867
Hearing words
that I have never heard

162
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,952
From a man

163
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:54,541
I've yet to meet

164
00:13:54,542 --> 00:14:01,590
He would be a kind
of handsome combination

165
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,761
Of Ronald Colman Charles Boyer

166
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,307
And Bing

167
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,101
Margy. My dear, little Margy.

168
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:18,315
I'd make the world a ruby for
your little finger and say,

169
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:24,154
"I love you.
I love you. I love you."

170
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,616
Ah, Margy. You are beautiful.

171
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,619
You are so very beautiful.

172
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,373
And we feel so gay

173
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,209
In a melancholy way

174
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:43,508
That it might as well be spring

175
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,182
Margy!

176
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,773
- Hello, Margy.
- Hello, Harry.

177
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:11,493
No, I'm not mad.
I'm just disappointed.

178
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,955
Well, I'll see you when I get back.

179
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,533
Good-bye.

180
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,336
Gee, I wish I was going to
the fair with you tonight.

181
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,672
I'd rather be doing that
than anything I know.

182
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,675
- Oh, would you, Harry?
- Well, sure.

183
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:30,847
- Only I can't neglect my cows.
- Oh. Of course not.

184
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,850
- Say, I saw something today.
- What?

185
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,019
The sweetest bit of farmland
this side of Davenport.

186
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,064
I was thinking of puttin' a
bid in on it if you like it.

187
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,859
- If I like it?
- Well, sure.

188
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,572
You know I haven't made a plan since I was
12 years old that didn't include you.

189
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,324
- Got a house on it?
- Yeah, but it's too old.

190
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,202
- We'd have to build a new one.
- Oh, I like old houses.

191
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,580
It wouldn't fit in
with our kind of farm.

192
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:01,418
You know, I plan to do everything my
old man won't let me do on his place.

193
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,839
Scientific irrigation, electric
milking, separate hen roosts.

194
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,717
No horses. All tractor power.

195
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,970
- You see what I mean? Everything modern.
- But the house you live in...

196
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,308
It's gotta be the same. No
clapboard and shingle business.

197
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,019
There's a new kind of
plastic, prefabricated job.

198
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,813
I want you to see it.
Got the catalog at home.

199
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,149
- Is it pretty?
- Sure!

200
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,487
But what's more important,
it's termite-proof.

201
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,156
Wait till you see it. And they
tell you how to furnish it too.

202
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,117
No rugs or carpets.
They're just dust collectors.

203
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:38,622
- What's on the floor?
- Linoleum through the whole house.

204
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:44,169
Wait till you see the pictures. It's slick
and smooth and easy to keep clean.

205
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,422
Well, it's like every room
in the house was a bathroom.

206
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,175
- Sounds real cozy.
- Yeah, don't it, though?

207
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,553
- What I've always wanted.
- Oh, sure. It's the only way to live.

208
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,847
- Everything's sanitary.
- Sure.

209
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,517
- And if we had children...
- Oh, Margy!

210
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,228
I said if by any strange
chance we had children,

211
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,939
why, I could dress them
in cellophane rompers.

212
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,358
Say, I didn't know they had...

213
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,902
Life will just be ducky...

214
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:13,281
In our air-conditioned
patent-leather farmhouse

215
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,533
Plastic.

216
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:19,704
On our ultramodern scientific farm

217
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,709
We'll live in a streamlined heaven

218
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,714
And we'll waste no time on charm

219
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:35,220
No geraniums to clutter our veranda

220
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:40,475
Nor a single, little
sentimental thing

221
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:45,352
No Virginia creepers
Nothing useless

222
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,487
- What's the matter, honey?
- Oh, nothing.

223
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,073
Just restless, I guess.

224
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,201
Sure. I understand.
You like to travel.

225
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,080
Well, I figured we'd make a little
trip, California or Bermuda or...

226
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,749
if it was May, we could go to
Washington, see the cherry trees.

227
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,586
- A honeymoon?
- That's what.

228
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,130
I'd almost marry you
to make the trip, Harry.

229
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:15,176
No kiddin' now, Margy. What do
you say? What do you say?

230
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,639
Well, I won't say anything
just now, Harry.

231
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,935
- Well, after the fair, maybe?
- Maybe.

232
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,726
Wow!

233
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,434
Look at him, Marge!

234
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,949
Holy cow! Gets bigger
every time I see him.

235
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,452
Biggest boar in the world, I bet.

236
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,076
All depends on how you spell it.

237
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,764
Eleanor can't go.

238
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,453
- Where's your mincemeat, Ma?
- Right here between my feet.

239
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:27,624
- Is the top on tight?
- Certainly, it's on tight.

240
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,959
- Why?
- Oh, nothin'.

241
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,084
Just don't want the flavor
to escape, that's all.

242
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,641
- Hello, Miss Frake!
- Hello, there!

243
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,685
- How are you?
- Just fine.

244
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,395
We'll come see you as
soon as we get settled.

245
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,223
Yes, do that.

246
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,530
If Wayne doesn't come back soon to
take me around, I'm going by myself.

247
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,324
I do wish your father
would come to his breakfast.

248
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,744
If he'd rather stay with Blue
Boy than eat, well, let him.

249
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,496
But I've got
my whole day planned out.

250
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,415
Don't you know you can't
plan out a whole day?

251
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,869
- There's no such thing.
- I do it all the time.

252
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:57,377
You sound just like Harry. He thinks
you can plan out your whole life.

253
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,048
So you can.

254
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,756
Is that what he was
talking about yesterday?

255
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,179
Uh-huh.

256
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,929
Did you come to anything definite?

257
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,058
Uh-uh.

258
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,187
I don't know
what you're waiting for.

259
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:16,733
It would serve you right if Harry up and
married that Skidmore girl instead of you.

260
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,818
I almost hope he does.

261
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,236
Me too.

262
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,289
Step right up, ladies
and gentlemen.

263
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,375
Move in a little closer.
Don't be afraid.

264
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,546
Hurry, hurry! Play the game!
Three rings for a dime.

265
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,049
Prizes worth up to $20.

266
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,760
Positively no blanks. The prize
you win is the prize you get,

267
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,887
the prize you take away.

268
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,224
Don't any gentleman
want to try his skill?

269
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,143
Ain't nobody here
got the pioneer spirit?

270
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,270
I tell you what I'm going to do.

271
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:59,484
I'm goin' to put down three nice,
new, crisp one-dollar bills.

272
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:03,571
One here, one here, and one here.

273
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,908
Now, who will spend a dime
for three chances at $3.00?

274
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,326
Is that real money?

275
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,995
If you win 'em and you
don't like 'em, buddy,

276
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,198
I'll give you
a dollar apiece for 'em.

277
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,419
Hey, mister,
them hoops look mighty small.

278
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,256
- Do they fit over those things?
- Lots of people do it, sir.

279
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,883
- Lots of people do it.
- Yeah, I did it last year.

280
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,094
Remember me? I won a
pearl-handled revolver.

281
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,179
Well, now, there. You see?

282
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,598
Young Mr. Daniel Boone here
won a revolver off me

283
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,518
right at this very fair a year ago.

284
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,563
Bring down any grizzly bears
with that shootin' iron, sonny?

285
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,566
Tell you what I'll do with you.

286
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:43,736
I'll just give you three rings on
the house to start things off.

287
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,782
Three chances for nothing.
I can't win. I can only lose.

288
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,452
But I love the game.

289
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,417
Remember, young man, you're
enjoying the courtesy of the house.

290
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,495
Don't cost us money.

291
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,300
I just lost $2.00!

292
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,803
But I'm having fun.
I love the game.

293
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,306
Here, my boy. I want you
to have a fair shake.

294
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,142
That ring looks warped.
Try this one.

295
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,471
This one's all right.

296
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,484
Well, well, you all see
how easy it is.

297
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,654
- Who else wants to try?
- I'll try again. Here's a dime.

298
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,283
- Who else wants a chance at a big prize?
- Here, mister, here's my dime.

299
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,827
How about you, sir? You look
like you've got a good aim.

300
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,830
- Why, you got a customer.
- Give me three rings. Here's my dime.

301
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,292
He's trying to dodge the boy!

302
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,712
- All right, buddy. Here ya are.
- You didn't put any dollar bills back.

303
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:46,799
Ain't pearl necklaces and safety
razors good enough for ya?

304
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,719
Can't you enjoy the game
for the game's sake?

305
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,639
Are ya money mad?

306
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,683
Those prizes are all fakes, but I'll
win 'em anyway just to prove it.

307
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,852
Quite a character.

308
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,314
Step up, folks.
We're havin' fun here.

309
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,692
Just lost a pearl necklace,
but I'm laughing.

310
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,279
I love the game.

311
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,699
Why, the young man
is winnin' a fortune.

312
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,745
- Here you are, buddy.
- Look, pot metal molded in one piece.

313
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,664
What good's a vanity case
it won't even open?

314
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,207
Okay, fella, you had your fun.

315
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,375
Now, come on. Move along.

316
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,918
And those clocks,
they don't have any works.

317
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,044
What good are they?

318
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,963
Listen, kid, you know what
I'm payin' for this pitch?

319
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,173
- No. What?
- More dough than you'll ever see.

320
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,425
So you spend a dime,
take $3.00 in cash

321
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,719
and then try to tell the
public my prizes are no good!

322
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,596
Well, they aren't.
They're just a lot of junk.

323
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,307
Look, you, I've been nice
just long enough.

324
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,769
- Now, beat it, or I'll call a policeman.
- Why don't you?

325
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,815
- What's that?
- I said, why don't you call a policeman?

326
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,067
He's only trying to bluff you.
The law says

327
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,528
he's got to sell you
all the rings you want.

328
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,489
- Otherwise, you can close up his place.
- Oh, a smart dame, huh?

329
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,367
A law student. Now, you listen
to me, Arsenic and Glamour,

330
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,203
- I don't know who you are...
- I'll tell you who I am.

331
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,998
My father's the chief
of police here.

332
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,293
- Your father is...
- The chief of police.

333
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,628
I was standing here
and saw the whole thing.

334
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,965
Say, how did you
get so good at this?

335
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,093
It's kind of a silly thing to be good at,
isn't it? But he made me sore last year.

336
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,429
I was trying for one of those
pearl-handled revolvers.

337
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,433
It cost me about $8.00. When I finally
did win it, it wasn't a revolver at all.

338
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,013
- It wouldn't even shoot. It was just a toy.
- Oh, ho!

339
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,064
- Defrauding the public, huh?
- Now, look, wait a minute.

340
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,942
I wouldn't have minded that so much,
but he kidded me in front of the crowd.

341
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,320
- So I...
- You practiced all year just to get even?

342
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,990
That's right. I figured I'd come back
and make as big a fool out of him

343
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,117
- as he made out of me.
- Oh, no, you don't.

344
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,327
Will you give him $8.00 back
if he promises to lay off?

345
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,289
- Look, you, I don't care who your father is.
- Okay.

346
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,583
Here. Here, here.

347
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,586
Here's your eight bucks,
and you don't come back, see?

348
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,672
- Is it a deal?
- Think it's all right to take it?

349
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,468
Well, sure, it's all right.
Here you are. Good-bye.

350
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,137
Good-bye!

351
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,307
Oh, don't leave, folks.
Prizes up to $20.

352
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,977
- Ah!
- Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!

353
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,188
We're having fun here!

354
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,732
Gee, it was swell of you to stand
up for me like that. Thanks.

355
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,193
Well, that's all right.
He had it coming to him.

356
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,653
Well, uh, now that you helped
me get my money back,

357
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,905
how about helping me spend it?

358
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,158
- No, that won't be necessary.
- What about a frozen custard?

359
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,243
- No, thank you. I believe not.
- Hot dog?

360
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,788
No. Really, I have an appointment.
I'm late already.

361
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,373
Won't I see you again? How about tonight?
Will you be on the midway?

362
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,376
Tonight? Yes, I think so.

363
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,004
I hope so.
I'll sure be looking for you.

364
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,840
- Do that. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

365
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,401
You sure you won't change your mind?
How about some popcorn?

366
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,563
Get tickets now if
you care to ride.

367
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,191
Train's now ready to leave.

368
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,861
Get your tickets for this ride.

369
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,274
All aboard if you care to ride.

370
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,784
- The train is now...
- One, please.

371
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,995
Please get tickets for this ride.

372
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,291
It's the longest,
the highest, the fastest,

373
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,670
the safest ride at the fairground.

374
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,381
Get tickets now if
you care to ride.

375
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,835
Hey, Pappy, there aren't
any seats together.

376
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,304
Oh. Say, mister, do you mind
sitting in the seat behind?

377
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,597
Thanks a lot.

378
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,098
Thanks.

379
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:34,983
- All aboard!
- Okay. There they go! Hold your seats.

380
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:40,944
They're off on a race through
the clouds. A thrill a minute!

381
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,878
Sit down!

382
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,141
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

383
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,309
I'm sorry.

384
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,772
Haven't you ever been on one
of these things before?

385
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,900
Not since I was a little girl.

386
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,694
- I used to be afraid of them.
- But you're not now.

387
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,239
That's what I wanted to find out.

388
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,501
Here comes another dip.

389
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:48,302
It's nearly over now.
Here's the tunnel.

390
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,522
Johnny, stop that!

391
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,575
Everybody out, folks.
Everybody out.

392
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,578
- I'm going around again.
- You gotta have a ticket.

393
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,414
- Press pass.
- Oh.

394
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,752
- Is the lady going around again too?
- No, thanks. I've had enough.

395
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,797
The safest ride at the fair.

396
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,423
Get tickets now for this ride.

397
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,599
Go and get tickets for this ride.

398
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,726
It is the longest,

399
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:35,564
fastest thrill ride
at the fairgrounds.

400
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:39,110
Get tickets now
if you care to ride.

401
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,115
Three rings for a dime. Hurry.

402
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,535
- You feel safer down here?
- Oh!

403
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,620
- I thought you were...
- I changed my mind.

404
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,747
I was standing there
watching you walk away.

405
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,084
Every step you took, your hair bounced
up and down on the back of your neck.

406
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:58,838
It was really nice. I don't know if
that's what got me, but here I am.

407
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,132
Now it's your turn
to say something.

408
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,592
What can I say? I don't know you.

409
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,304
- I can arrange that.
- And all you know about me

410
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,181
is that my hair bounces
up and down when I walk.

411
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,893
- Everybody's hair bounces up and down.
- Mine doesn't.

412
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,516
I mean, girls.

413
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,779
Well, look over there.

414
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:31,454
Well, maybe it wasn't your hair. Maybe
it was the way you held your shoulders.

415
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,909
- Walk away again. Let me see.
- All right.

416
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,133
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

417
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,469
- Where are you going?
- You told me to walk away.

418
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,179
- Yeah, but I...
- Really, I have to go anyway.

419
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,472
- Why?
- Well, I...

420
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,349
Well, what? What are you afraid of?

421
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,351
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Good.

422
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,603
Then what would be wrong with you
and me sitting down over there

423
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,854
and exchanging our ideas
of life over a Coke?

424
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,106
Nothing wrong. It's just that...

425
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,567
I'm not saying it's a great idea.
I'm just asking what's bad about it.

426
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,288
What could we lose? Let's give it
five minutes. What do you say?

427
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:13,746
Here we are, two people who
know nothing about each other.

428
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:18,084
Maybe we should. Maybe it would be
fun to find out what we're like.

429
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,212
- Maybe it'll be dull.
- What do we do if it's dull?

430
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,173
- We break it up.
- How do we do that?

431
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,592
One of us just says, "Let's
break it up." That's the end.

432
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,762
You go east, I go west. No hard
feelings. No questions asked.

433
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,591
- Ag reed?
- Ag reed.

434
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,721
Okay. Here we go.

435
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,270
Hold on! Here we go!

436
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:04,338
Hearing words
that I have never heard

437
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:10,387
From a man I've yet to meet

438
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,976
Now, with rolly coasters,
that's different. They're fun.

439
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,602
You oughta see the one in New York.

440
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,187
There's one in Chicago
that's pretty good.

441
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,689
There's one out at
the beach in Los Angeles.

442
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,900
It's not bad, but the one in New York,
the one across the river, that's the one.

443
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,320
- It's got a dip of 200 feet.
- You've been everywhere, haven't you?

444
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,698
Not yet. When I first
started out in this game,

445
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,825
I worked around
on different papers.

446
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,494
But now, I'm afraid the great Des
Moines Register's got me hog-tied.

447
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,538
Someday, I'll work on
a bigger paper though.

448
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,540
I'm sure you will.

449
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,376
Well, I think I'd better go
the rest of the way alone.

450
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,337
I'd have a pretty hard time
explaining you to my folks.

451
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,632
Yeah, I guess you would. Everybody
has a hard time explaining me.

452
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,461
- See you again?
- Well, I...

453
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,471
Or would you like to say,
"Let's break it up"?

454
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,722
Oh, no! Well, I mean, do you?

455
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,644
Look, bobbylocks,
don't worry about me.

456
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,938
Anytime I wanna throw in the
sponge, you'll know it.

457
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,232
I just won't be around.

458
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,985
Well, I don't know what the
family's plans are for tonight.

459
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,112
- I don't know where I'll be.
- I'll find you.

460
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,239
- How?
- I'm a newspaperman.

461
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,909
It's my job to find the right
people at the right time.

462
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,863
You'll be seeing me. So long.

463
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,286
So long.

464
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,641
What's the matter with you?

465
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,605
What's the trouble, Blue Boy?

466
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,399
Ain't you feelin' good?

467
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,944
This ain't like you, son.

468
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,196
- Ain't sick, is he?
- Huh?

469
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:56,659
Sick? Oh, no, no.
He's in fine shape.

470
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,828
Just had a long trip. Kind of
resting up a bit, that's all.

471
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,997
Oh. I thought he was sick.

472
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,293
Oh, no. He's never
felt better in his life.

473
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,759
You see what a spectacle
you made of yourself?

474
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,970
What are people
gonna say about you?

475
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,305
- Hello, Hank.
- Hello, there.

476
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,349
- What you got this year?
- Never you mind.

477
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,352
She'll put anything you've got
in the shade. You wait and see.

478
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,313
- Come on. Get along, there. Get along.
- Hello, Hank.

479
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,649
Hello, there, Frake. How are ya?

480
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,693
Ah. You got a duroc this time, huh?

481
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,862
- And a good one too. Get in there.
- She's got nice color.

482
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,407
Well, she oughta have.
Her mother before her

483
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,867
was the most beautiful red
sow in the whole world.

484
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,995
- What's her name?
- Esmeralda.

485
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:44,291
And she'll win the
sweepstakes sure.

486
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,850
Now you look like something.

487
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:06,103
I don't mind telling you, though,
you had me worried, son,

488
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,188
but I knew you'd come through.

489
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,642
Now you look like a real champion.

490
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,625
- Oh! Excuse me.
- Oh!

491
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,710
Why don't you look where you're goin'?
Gawking around like that,

492
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,795
people'll think you've never
been to a fair before.

493
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,048
I just thought we might meet
somebody we know.

494
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,051
- So what?
- Well, why are you looking around?

495
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,178
Who are you looking for?

496
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,806
I sort of had a half date, with
a guy I met here last year.

497
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,892
- Why don't you keep it?
- What would I do with you?

498
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,977
- Well, look, Wayne...
- I beg your pardon, sir.

499
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,146
- May I trouble you for a match?
- Sure.

500
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,066
- I think I have some right here.
- That's very kind of you.

501
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,314
Okay.

502
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,071
- Here you are. Thanks.
- Why don't you keep them?

503
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:01,116
- My brother has another pack.
- Sure, sure. Go ahead.

504
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,116
- That's okay.
- Thank you very much.

505
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,624
- You're certainly big with my matches.
- What do you care?

506
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,585
Your pockets are always
full of them.

507
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,339
Look, Wayne, if you really wanna keep your
date with that friend, I wouldn't mind.

508
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,007
- You wouldn't?
- No.

509
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,593
I hardly slept a wink
in that old truck last night.

510
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,762
What I really wanted to do
tonight was to go to bed early

511
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,972
but I didn't wanna disappoint you.

512
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,100
Oh, don't worry about me.

513
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,602
Uh, maybe you'd better.
You do look a little tired.

514
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,438
- And I can get back all right.
- Ah, that's swell, sis.

515
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,774
Thanks. I mean, get
a good rest now.

516
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,023
I will.

517
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,785
Hello.

518
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,788
Take home a beautiful
pennant from the state fair.

519
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,873
Come right over. Help yourself.

520
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,042
Oh, pardon me. I'm looking for
the chief of police's daughter.

521
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,962
- Have you seen her around here anyplace?
- His daughter?

522
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,131
I don't believe I know her.

523
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,372
There's the chief over there.
Why don't you ask him?

524
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,424
Okay. Thank you.

525
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,395
- Good evening, Chief.
- Good evening, son. What can I do for you?

526
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,938
Could you tell me where
your daughter is?

527
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,815
I sort of had a date
to meet her here tonight.

528
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,276
- What?
- Well, it wasn't exactly a date.

529
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,361
She said... I mean, I told her...

530
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:23,407
Well, let's see.
She's around here somewhere.

531
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,700
Oh, Violet?

532
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,454
Yes, Daddy?

533
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:32,125
This young gentleman tells me you two
have a date to go out stepping tonight.

534
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,126
Huh?

535
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:37,421
Well, I guess I must
mean her sister.

536
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,590
I haven't got a sister.

537
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,344
Looks like someone's been
pulling your leg, my boy.

538
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,890
Yeah. That's a pretty good
joke on me, all right.

539
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,092
Well, thanks.

540
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,101
How many, please?

541
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,978
- Huh?
- How many tickets?

542
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,806
Oh. One.

543
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,425
And now for your favorite,

544
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,551
the lovely Emily Edwards,
and That's For Me.

545
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,730
Right

546
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:41,902
Between the eyes

547
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,405
Quite a belt

548
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:49,743
That blow I felt this morning

549
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,079
Fate

550
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,376
Gave me no warning

551
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,087
Great

552
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,423
Was my surprise

553
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,262
I saw you standing in the sun

554
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:12,891
And you were something to see

555
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:17,104
I know what I like
and I liked what I saw

556
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:23,278
And I said to myself that's for me

557
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,115
A lovely morning I remarked

558
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:32,744
And you were quick to agree

559
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,623
You wanted to walk
and I nodded my head

560
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,084
As I breathlessly said

561
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:43,422
That's for me

562
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:48,176
I left you standing under stars

563
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:52,598
The day's adventures are through

564
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,643
There's nothing for me
but the dream in my heart

565
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,770
And the dream in my heart

566
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:03,692
That's for you

567
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,403
Oh, my darling

568
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,654
That's for you

569
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,332
- There you are.
- Thank you.

570
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,878
- Who's that singing?
- That's Emily Edwards.

571
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,923
She's kind of cute,
but she's not my type.

572
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,634
She's a redhead.

573
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,470
Now, with brown hair,
that's different.

574
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,472
- Hello, Pat.
- Hi, Pat.

575
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,557
- Hi, girls.
- How are you doin', honey?

576
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:39,513
- Quiet, you.
- I guess you know a lot of girls, don't you?

577
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,563
Well, in my racket, you know...

578
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:47,737
For you

579
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,463
- I, uh, just spoke to your father.
- My who?

580
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,924
Your father. You know,
the chief of police.

581
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,969
Oh, that. Didn't you know
I was kidding?

582
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,054
Well, I do now.

583
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,350
And just for that, you're gonna
have to have a drink with me.

584
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,522
When I first saw you up there,
I couldn't believe you were the same girl.

585
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,898
Why not? Was I that bad?

586
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,318
I didn't mean it that way.
You were good, wonderful.

587
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,656
That's just it. A girl singer like
you with Tommy Thomas's band,

588
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,826
I couldn't figure out why you went
to all that trouble today just for me.

589
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:40,330
- Why shouldn't I? What's wrong with you?
- Oh, nothing wrong with me.

590
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,205
I mean, well, maybe there is,
but don't tell me.

591
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,626
- Like to dance?
- Uh-huh. Do you?

592
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:53,220
Sure. That's why
I brought it up. Sure.

593
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,968
- We can get our drinks later.
- All right.

594
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,727
The big feature ride of the fair.

595
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:05,063
Get your tickets for the next ride.

596
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:10,777
This is the highest, fastest,
safest ride at the fairgrounds.

597
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:14,448
Get tickets now
for the big, fast ride.

598
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:19,077
- Come on. I dare you.
- I'm game.

599
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,655
- How many?
- Two, please.

600
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,305
- What you thinking about?
- Why?

601
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,099
Oh, you sort of had
a funny smile on your face.

602
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,518
- You really want to know?
- Uh-huh.

603
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,772
Well, I was just thinking about
you practicing all that time

604
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:50,650
with your mother's embroidery hoops
just to get even with somebody.

605
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,986
I guess you think I'm kind
of screwy, don't you?

606
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,489
No, I don't. I don't at all.

607
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,992
As a matter of fact,
I like that kind of a fellow.

608
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,162
That's lucky for me, because
I like the kind of a girl

609
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,457
who likes that kind of fellow.

610
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,586
It's a grand night for singing

611
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,631
The moon is flying high

612
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:17,052
And somewhere a bird
who is bound he'll be heard

613
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,680
ls throwing his heart at the sky

614
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,893
It's a grand night for singing

615
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:28,188
The stars are bright above

616
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:32,526
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

617
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:36,696
I think I am falling in love

618
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,824
Falling

619
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:42,620
Falling in love

620
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:48,041
It's a grand night for singing

621
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:52,045
The stars are bright above

622
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,841
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

623
00:43:55,842 --> 00:44:00,011
I think I am falling in love

624
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:06,219
Falling
Falling in love

625
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,731
Maybe it's more than the moon

626
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:15,485
Maybe it's more than the birds

627
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,905
Maybe it's more
than the sight of the night

628
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:23,201
In a light too lovely for words

629
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,080
Maybe it's more than the earth

630
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,834
Shiny in silvery blue

631
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:34,713
Maybe the reason
I'm feeling this way

632
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:38,049
Has something to do with you

633
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,471
Say, you're pretty good in that
voice department yourself.

634
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,764
I'm an old glee club boy.

635
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,516
The moon is flying high

636
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,145
And somewhere a bird
who is bound he'll be heard

637
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:53,773
ls throwing his heart at the sky

638
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,944
It's a grand night for singing

639
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,781
The stars are bright above

640
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,660
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

641
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:09,873
I think I am falling in love

642
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,958
Falling

643
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,663
Falling in love

644
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:21,343
It's a grand night for singing

645
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:25,305
The moon is flying high

646
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:29,142
And somewhere a bird
who is bound he'll be heard

647
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,687
Is throwing his heart at the sky

648
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:37,150
It's a grand night for singing

649
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,987
The stars are bright above

650
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,991
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

651
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:49,287
I think I am falling in love

652
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,331
Falling

653
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:57,414
Falling in love

654
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:13,144
And you were something to see

655
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,189
I know what I like
and I liked what I saw

656
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,695
And I said to myself that's for me

657
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,990

I left you standing under stars

663
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:46,803
- The day's adventures are through
- Ow!

664
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,931
There's nothing for me
but the dream in my heart

665
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,435
And the dream in my heart that's

666
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:57,731
For you

667
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:03,486
Oh, my darling

668
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,741
That's

669
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,911
For you

670
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,331
Hey, cut that out!

671
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,584
I'll get you for that. You wait
and see now. You just wait.

672
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,045
You two sound like you had
a wonderful time last night.

673
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,172
- Sure did.
- Mmm, terrific.

674
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:27,844
Wish your father was enjoying himself
instead of brooding over that old pig.

675
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:32,349
Say, I thought you were going
to bed early last night.

676
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,268
Oh. Well, I was going to,
but I changed my mind.

677
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,354
I went for a ride
on the roller coaster.

678
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:41,775
- It's much better than it was last year.
- Oh, okay.

679
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,778
I tell you, he's raring to go.

680
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,406
When I left him just now, he was
strutting around prouder than a peacock.

681
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,450
- You'd think he owned the place.
- Thank goodness.

682
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,619
Maybe now you'll
give me a little time.

683
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,954
Yes, sir, he's all right.
Wait till you see him.

684
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,833
There ain't a hog ever was or
ever will be that can touch him.

685
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:03,254
For what we're about to receive,
O Lord, make us duly thankful. Amen.

686
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,465
- You said grace before, Daddy.
- Yeah.

687
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:08,802
I did? Well, I'm going to
keep on saying it all day.

688
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:12,928
I just hope he stays like he
is till the judges see him!

689
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:55,974
Why, they hardly tasted them!
And I like my sweet pickles best.

690
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,852
They don't have to taste much.
They're experts.

691
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,431
Don't be so jittery, Mother.

692
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,525
- There's that Mrs. Metcalfe.
- Hmm?

693
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,900
- Behind the lady in the red hat.
- Oh, yes, I see her.

694
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:14,701
So biggety. Why, she was
just lucky last year.

695
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,412
Her pies weren't
half as good as yours.

696
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:20,707
- Why, hello, Mrs. Metcalfe. Pardon me.
- Hello.

697
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,876
Going to win all the
prizes again this year?

698
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:26,754
I don't know about all, but I have high
hopes for my pickles and mincemeat.

699
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,174
Same as you.

700
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,757
Look. They like your sour pickles.

701
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,080
This is the last year I'm
ever gonna enter anything.

702
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:05,127
- It isn't worth it.
- Oh, Mother, you say that every year.

703
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,813
Please.

704
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,610
Thank you.

705
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,493
Well, aren't they going
to announce their decision?

706
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,163
Not until they finish
with the mincemeat.

707
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,241
Thank you.

708
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,843
I don't remember telling you to
cover this part of the fair.

709
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,345
Hello, boss.

710
00:50:57,346 --> 00:51:01,140
Thought you were specializing in human
interest stories on the midway.

711
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,851
What's wrong with putting in a plug
for the housewives of our state?

712
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,146
That, my friend, is Mrs. America.

713
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,900
Do tell. And what dainty
putter-upper

714
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,237
of what delicious preserve is the
cause of your presence here?

715
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:18,116
Look, forget you're the managing editor of
a newspaper and try to act intelligent.

716
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,868
Have you ever seen me with
the type who's a good cook?

717
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,996
No, but I've seen you
with every other kind.

718
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,290
You had to get around
to these sometime.

719
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:28,251
Shove off. Let me finish this
story. It's for your paper.

720
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,879
Sure. Only I hope it's better than
the one you turned in last night,

721
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,799
"Fun on a Roller Coaster." Ouch.

722
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,468
Boy, you'd better hope
the old man misses that one

723
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,218
or he'll never give you a
shot at that job in Chicago.

724
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,564
That's yours, isn't it?

725
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,880
Mmm.

726
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,616
Do you think they liked it?

727
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:44,118
They must have. They
certainly ate enough.

728
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,288
Your attention, please.

729
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,582
Silence, please.

730
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,794
ladies and gentlemen.

731
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,713
Quiet, please!

732
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:01,842
We are now ready to announce
the awards. Sweet pickles.

733
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:08,936
First prize to Mrs. Edwin
Metcalfe of Pottsville.

734
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:19,278
Second prize to...

735
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,572
To Mrs. Agnes Field

736
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,867
of Arcadia.

737
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,030
Sour pickles.

738
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,416
First prize to

739
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:35,920
Mrs. Melissa Frake of Brunswick.

740
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,499
Oh, Mother.

741
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:48,684
Second prize to
Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe.

742
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:57,108
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

743
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:00,695
Quiet, please. As you know,

744
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:05,324
we occasionally give a plaque
for distinguished achievement.

745
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:09,162
As you are doubtlessly aware,

746
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:13,332
this plaque is only given
in rare cases.

747
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,461
And on this occasion,
my colleagues and I

748
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,671
have voted unanimously

749
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:23,134
that it be given to a lady who has
concocted the most delicious,

750
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:27,764
the most succulent
and spiciest mincemeat

751
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,516
ever entered in a state fair.

752
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:34,437
The lady who wins this distinction

753
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:40,276
is none other than Mrs.
Melissa Frake of Brunswick.

754
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:44,527
- Oh, Mother! Oh!
- Congratulations. I'm so glad.

755
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,789
I've got the most a woman
can get in life, Margy.

756
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,745
- If I think any more about it, I'll cry.
- Stand where you are, please.

757
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,588
Hold it. Thank you.

758
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:01,964
Thank you very much, ladies.

759
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,175
Your picture will appear in the
Register tomorrow morning.

760
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,052
Good day.

761
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:09,430
- See, Mother? You're famous.
- I'm worn out.

762
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,599
I'm going up to the trailer
and lie down.

763
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,228
I never knew what a strain it was
to get something you really wanted.

764
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,396
- I'll take these, dear.
- Oh, my hat too.

765
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:20,441
Now you run along
and enjoy yourself.

766
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,993
My horse is number 8,
Tessie In the green shirt.

767
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,832
Come on, Tessie! Come on!

768
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,177
Get up there. Come on!

769
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,426
Attagirl, Tessie.
Pass her! Pass her!

770
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,769
Attagirl, Tess!

771
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,145
Oh, she made it!

772
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,395
She won! She won!
Oh, Pat, your horse won!

773
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,963
it can't be much fun for you

774
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,924
just hanging around waiting
to catch me between songs.

775
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,645
Can't think of anything
I'd rather be doing.

776
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:33,347
Anyway, we can... I mean, can
we go someplace after the show?

777
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,641
I thought maybe we'd have
something to eat or something.

778
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,476
Well, I can't tonight, Wayne.

779
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,937
- It's Marty's birthday.
- Who's Marty?

780
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,482
The boy I sing with in the band. We're
giving a surprise party for him.

781
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,151
Wouldn't you like to come?

782
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,612
I was kind of counting
on being alone with you.

783
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,323
I know. I'd like that better too.

784
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,700
But this is a party
we cooked up a week ago.

785
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,827
We're giving it in my rooms
at the hotel

786
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,456
- so I can't very well back out now.
- Hey, Emily.

787
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:02,168
- They're playing the introduction.
- All right, Marty.

788
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,337
Now don't go away.
I'll be right back.

789
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,214
Okay, let's go.

790
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,431
Listen, kids, I got
the greatest number here...

791
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,683
McGee, if you ever scare me
like that again...

792
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,771
I got the greatest number I ever plugged,
and I'm gonna give you first crack at it.

793
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,273
Buzz off, McGee. We're busy.

794
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:28,524
Eh, just like all singers,
they don't like songs.

795
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,703
- Hi, buddy.
- Hello.

796
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,290
- You in the music business?
- No. I'm a farmer.

797
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:46,337
A farmer. What a night I'm having.

798
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,422
Well, uh, you're a friend
of Emily's, ain't ya?

799
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,548
That's right.

800
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:53,344
- My name's McGee.
- My name's Wayne Frake.

801
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,805
- You in the music business?
- Yeah, I'm a song plugger.

802
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,891
- I work on songs till they get popular.
- How do you mean work on 'em?

803
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,227
I thought songs got popular
because people like 'em.

804
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:04,981
That's naive. How can people like
a song if they don't hear it?

805
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,691
You got to get the big
singers to sing it first.

806
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:07,900
How do you do that?

807
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,487
There's all kinds of ways,
and none of them is easy.

808
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,408
You got no idea what a snook like me has
to do to get a song on the hit parade.

809
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,910
Last week I fell down in
front of Dinah Shore's taxi

810
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,787
just to get in
conversation with her.

811
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:23,499
Every Christmas, I got to remember
to send Sinatra a new bow tie.

812
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,418
When a bandleader's
wife has a baby,

813
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,587
I gotta stay home with it
on the nurse's night out.

814
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,298
It's a big question whether Mairzy
Doats would have been a hit

815
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,427
if I hadn't had known
how to change a "didey."

816
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:37,930
- Is that a new song you got there?
- Yeah, and it's a honey.

817
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,516
A natural for your friend Emily.

818
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,269
You wouldn't wanna help me
get it to her, would ya?

819
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,269
I am not at all niggardly
when it comes to payola.

820
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,476
- Payola?
- Ah, it's a technical term. Forget it.

821
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:55,948
The man who wrote this song is
starving in an attic in Brooklyn.

822
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,617
His wife ran out on him,
left him penniless with two kids.

823
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:02,663
She even took the piano with her
so now he can't write no more.

824
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:07,001
If this song ain't a hit, there's
only one thing left for this man,

825
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,294
the river.

826
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:13,090
On the other hand, if somebody was to
get a great artist like Emily Edwards

827
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,676
to introduce it with
a band on the radio,

828
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:20,223
this man's fortune would be made and
his genius preserved for posterity.

829
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,683
How do you know he ain't
another Stephen Foster?

830
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,394
- I don't. Only...
- Just read those words.

831
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,648
Here. Take a couple of copies. I'll hum
the tune so you can see how they fit.

832
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,193
Follow me.

833
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:42,154
Right there.

834
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:49,376
It's a grand night for singing

835
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:53,172
The stars are bright above

836
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:57,218
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

837
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:01,222
I think I am falling in love

838
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,307
Falling

839
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:07,311
Falling in love

840
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:11,148
Maybe it's more than the moon

841
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:15,111
Maybe it's more than the birds

842
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:18,614
Maybe it's more
than the sight of the night

843
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:23,077
In a light too lovely for words

844
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:26,455
Maybe it's more than the earth

845
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:31,127
Shiny in silvery blue

846
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:34,880
Maybe the reason
I'm feeling this way

847
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:38,551
Has something to do with you

848
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:43,013
It's a grand night for singing

849
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,809
The stars are bright above

850
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:51,021
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

851
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:55,484
I think I am falling in love

852
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,570
Falling

853
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:00,531
Falling in love

854
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,985
La, la, la, la, la, la

855
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,913
- Hey, where's my drink?
- Let's see what else we've got here.

856
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,082
Look, Wayne, how about
your singing a chorus?

857
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,043
No, thanks. You're doing
all right without me.

858
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,255
- But I want them to hear you.
- You can't be as good as she says.

859
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:19,758
- You'd be surprised. Come on.
- No, really.

860
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,094
Come on. Don't tell me
we have to coax you.

861
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,221
How about singing one
of those corn-fed ditties

862
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,599
you guys sing around
these little towns?

863
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,226
- Come on, Wayne. Sing anything you like.
- Yeah, you can't tell.

864
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,604
You might have something
we can use with the band.

865
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:35,107
As a matter of fact, if you need a new song,
I've got one right here I like very much.

866
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,818
He didn't expect to sing, but
he brought his music with him.

867
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,948
- Would you like to try it with me?
- You do it yourself.

868
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:46,949
- Did you write it?
- No, I didn't. A fellow gave it to me.

869
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,747
- Okay, bud.
- Okay, bud.

870
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,124
This ought to be something.

871
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:57,296
Maybe you'll never be
the love of my life

872
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:01,008
Maybe I'm not the boy
of your dreams

873
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:05,221
But isn't it kind of fun
to look in each other's eyes

874
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,974
Swapping romantic gleams

875
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:12,728
Maybe you're not a girl
to have and to hold

876
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,398
Maybe I'm not a boy who would stay

877
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,444
But isn't it kind of fun
carousing around the town

878
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:24,281
Dancing the night away

879
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:28,077
Isn't it kind of fun holding hands

880
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:31,997
According to a sweet
and corny custom

881
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,876
Isn't it kind of fun making vows

882
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:39,922
Admitting that we both
intend to bust 'em

883
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,926
Maybe we're out for laughs
A girl and a boy

884
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:47,304
Kidding across a table for two

885
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:51,517
But haven't you got a hunch
that this is the real McCoy

886
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:55,229
And all the things
we tell each other

887
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,478
Are true

888
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,487
I'm not a girl
for sentimental tripe

889
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:07,366
I never go for the Romeo type

890
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:11,120
Over a dewy-eyed Juliet

891
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:15,040
No one has seen me drool yet

892
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,544
I don't say our hearts are tied

893
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:22,548
By love's eternal tether

894
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:27,678
But using words less dignified

895
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,557
Isn't it kind of fun to be together

896
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:35,227
Maybe you'll never be
the love of my life

897
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:39,064
Maybe I'm not the girl
of your dreams

898
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:43,027
But isn't it kind of fun
to look in each other's eyes

899
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:46,822
Swapping romantic gleams

900
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:50,743
Maybe I'm not a girl
to have and to hold

901
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:54,580
Well, maybe I'm not
a boy who would stay

902
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,417
But isn't it kind of fun
carousing around the town

903
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:02,254
Dancing the night away

904
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:06,300
Oh, isn't it kind
of fun holding hands

905
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:10,179
According to a sweet
and corny custom

906
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:14,141
Isn't it kind of fun making vows

907
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:18,020
Admitting that we both
intend to bust 'em

908
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:22,107
Maybe we're out for laughs
A girl and a boy

909
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:25,819
Kidding across a table for two

910
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,698
- But haven't you got a hunch
- That this is the real McCoy

911
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,285
And all the things
we tell each other

912
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:37,957
Are true

913
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,627
- Wonderful.
- That was great.

914
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:44,838
You know, you're right about
that song, Wayne. I like it too.

915
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,216
- You do?
- "Billings Publishing Company," huh?

916
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,385
- A guy named McGee give you this?
- That's right.

917
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,095
How much did he slip you
for plugging it tonight?

918
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,304
Wait a minute, Marty!

919
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,430
He didn't slip me anything.

920
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,140
Didn't he promise to come
through with the old payola?

921
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,477
- He used that expression.
- I'll bet he did. That's great, Emily.

922
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,396
Your boyfriend cashing in on you.

923
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,611
- How do you like that?
- Wayne!

924
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,906
Wayne.

925
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,909
Wayne, wait a minute.

926
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,328
I'm sorry, Emily.
I just couldn't help it.

927
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,330
He's been putting in digs
ever since I got here.

928
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,705
I know he was asking for it,
but please don't go.

929
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,629
You don't think I'd cash in on being
friends with you like he said, do you?

930
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,008
Of course not. And he wouldn't have
said it, only he's had a few drinks.

931
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,053
- Please come back.
- It just wouldn't work, Emily.

932
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:36,053
I'd let him have it the first
time he opened his mouth.

933
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,183
Look. Why don't you
walk around the block?

934
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:41,388
Give me a chance to get rid
of them. How about that?

935
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,524
I'd hate to have you
break up the party.

936
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,359
I'll tell them I have a headache.

937
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,358
When you come back, we'll be alone.

938
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,989
That's the way
you wanted it, isn't it?

939
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,621
- Okay. How long?
- Come back in half an hour.

940
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,040
Emily, I...

941
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,268
- Half an hour.
- Make it 15 minutes.

942
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,233
All right.

943
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,136
Only a few stars left.

944
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,765
Yeah, and they look kind of tired.

945
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,059
Funny how a day creeps on.

946
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,437
So slowly at first
you think it's never coming.

947
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:09,191
Then all of a sudden,
it spreads out over the sky,

948
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,315
the sun starts shining.

949
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,818
People loom up like that too.

950
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:21,119
Are you really gonna go home and
marry that guy you're engaged to?

951
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,832
That's what girls usually do, isn't it?
Marry the men they're engaged to.

952
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,661
Yeah. They're usually
sorry afterward.

953
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,965
Think you'll every marry?

954
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:36,760
Who, me? Sure. Sometime.

955
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,763
Only trouble is, if I ever found
a girl I cared that much about,

956
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,975
I'd care too much about it to
wish a guy like me off on her.

957
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:47,646
- Sounds kind of hopeless.
- I guess it is.

958
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,148
It's pretty hard for me
to picture myself,

959
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,484
what do they call it,
popping the question.

960
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,654
Can you imagine me suddenly turning
to some girl and blurting out,

961
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,198
"Will you marry me?"

962
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,790
No. I can see you wouldn't.

963
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,711
Well, bobbylocks, you've
made a very wise decision.

964
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:14,792
Anyway, I'd be no good
for you, no good at all.

965
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,920
Of course, you'd be
awfully good for me.

966
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,724
Say, what about your old man's hog?

967
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,605
Aren't they gonna judge
him this afternoon?

968
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:31,224
Oh, yes. I guess
I'd better be going.

969
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:36,194
- Wayne's probably in already.
- it's getting pretty late.

970
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:40,616
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- No. It's better if you don't.

971
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,118
- Will I see you tonight?
- In front of the roller coaster?

972
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,411
8:30.

973
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,498
Well, I...

974
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:58,376
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

975
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,182
- Pat?
- Yes?

976
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:10,514
I was only talking. I couldn't
marry anybody but you, ever.

977
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:31,583
Well, Blue Boy,
this is the great day,

978
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,161
your hour of judgment.

979
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,966
Now take it easy there now.
Don't get your face dirty.

980
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:44,513
Look, Mother, Blue Boy's already
won. There's his blue ribbon.

981
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,307
Oh, that thing?
That's only the class award.

982
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:50,268
That means he's won
his class of senior boars.

983
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:53,605
I'm getting him ready now to go
in for the grand championship.

984
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,733
- Is he all right?
- All right? Why, just look at him.

985
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,777
He's fit as a fiddle.

986
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:02,614
Class 51, Hampshire senior sows,

987
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:06,284
- pavilion number two.
- Better go in now, son.

988
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,578
Get seated.
We go in right after this.

989
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:09,996
- We'd better get going.
- Good luck, Pa.

990
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,124
- Thanks, Ma.
- You too, Blue Boy.

991
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:15,955
- We'll be pulling for you.
- All right. Bye. See you later.

992
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:18,089
Well, let's see.

993
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,591
Is your face clean, son?
Yes, you're all right.

994
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,295
You gotta look your best, you know.

995
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:31,935
You taking her in, Hank?

996
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:35,561
No, not yet. Just taking her
out to put her on the scale.

997
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,868
Blue Boy, what's the matter, son?

998
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,454
Oh, you think
Esmeralda's gone home.

999
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,331
No, she's just gone
out to be weighed.

1000
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:56,585
Hampshire boars, get ready, please.

1001
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,336
That's us, son. Come on. Get up.

1002
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,590
Oh, don't act this way.
Esmeralda will be back.

1003
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,468
She ain't gonna be judged
until after you win.

1004
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:08,014
Come on, boy. Get up.

1005
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,557
You hear that? That's the band.
They're playing for you, son.

1006
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,886
You can't lay down on me now.

1007
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,313
Oh, come on, fella, please.

1008
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,955
Attention, please. Attention.

1009
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,541
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, I have the honor

1010
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:40,504
of introducing to you
a man whom you all know,

1011
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,465
Congressman James A. Goodheart.

1012
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:54,059
During this great day
of boar judging,

1013
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,685
you have seen hundreds

1014
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:59,856
of seemingly perfect boars
eliminated,

1015
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:02,317
leaving only two contestants,

1016
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,237
the junior champion
and the senior champion,

1017
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,739
both perfect specimens

1018
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,820
representing excellence
of breeding.

1019
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:16,164
The judges realize the
importance of their decision,

1020
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,834
for the boar
they decide is the better

1021
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:23,171
will be acclaimed
grand champion boar

1022
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,591
of this year's state fair.

1023
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,939
Introducing the first contestant,

1024
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,190
Whirlwind...

1025
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:46,025
number 188.

1026
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,865
Winner, junior champion boar.

1027
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:54,654
Owner, Mr. R.C. Martin.

1028
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,415
He's awful big, isn't he?

1029
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,493
Blue Boy will outpoint him.

1030
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:10,176
And now, for the second contestant,

1031
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,470
introducing Blue Boy.

1032
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:16,426
- Where's Dad?
- Yes, now what?

1033
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,476
Where is he?

1034
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,100
Introducing Blue Boy,

1035
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:26,645
number 1494.

1036
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:31,406
Winning senior champion boar.

1037
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,781
Owner, Mr. Abel Frake.

1038
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,888
Whoa, Blue Boy.

1039
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:11,447
Whoa, Blue Boy. Whoa, Blue Boy.

1040
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:15,902
Whoa, Blue Boy.

1041
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:31,841
They didn't look at him
very long, did they?

1042
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,385
They'll be back.

1043
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:56,282
Blue Boy, get up. Get up on your
feet. The judges will see you.

1044
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:59,578
Oh, this is terrible.
He'll lose sure.

1045
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,952
Get up, Blue Boy. Blue Boy!

1046
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,877
Come on, son. Get up. Son?

1047
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,759
What's the matter with him?
Get him up.

1048
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,555
- We can't judge him lying down.
- Come on, Blue Boy! Get up, will ya?

1049
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:23,059
Blue Boy, come on!
Blue Boy, come on.

1050
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:29,107
Come on, son. Get up.

1051
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,651
Come on, Blue Boy.
Get up, will you?

1052
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:34,321
Come on, Blue Boy. Come on.

1053
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:39,660
Just a little tired, that's all.

1054
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:12,609
Attention, please. Attention.

1055
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:17,031
I have the honor to announce the winner
of this year's grand championship.

1056
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:21,235
Hampshire boar, Blue Boy.

1057
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,389
it gives me great pleasure.
Congratulations.

1058
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:47,352
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy!

1059
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,978
- Oh, Pa!
- Congratulations, Mr. Frake.

1060
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,152
My, my. Whoever wrote this

1061
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:59,280
must be a friend
of the Frake family.

1062
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,783
"As Mr. Abel Frake
won the grand award,

1063
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,619
"he was watched from the
grandstand by his charming wife,

1064
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,206
"and talented and beautiful
daughter Marguerite."

1065
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:11,042
- Come on, Wayne. It's getting late.
- Just a minute.

1066
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,003
Say, you look mighty pretty tonight.
Is that a new dress?

1067
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:17,715
- Uh-huh. Do you like it?
- Prettiest girl I ever saw.

1068
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,008
Okay, I'm ready.

1069
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,177
Not too late now. We wanna get
an early start in the morning.

1070
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:24,222
Might be a little late. It's the
last night. So long, Dad.

1071
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,766
- Bye.
- So long.

1072
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,644
They look nice together,
don't they?

1073
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,597
Hmm? What'd you say?

1074
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:35,067
I said we had two lovely children.

1075
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,026
Who said we didn't?

1076
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,906
I wish Margy would make
up her mind about Harry.

1077
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:46,494
Why? He won't run away.
He's one of those goody-goody boys.

1078
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,122
I don't see anything
wrong with that.

1079
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,499
You were a good boy
when I fell in love with you.

1080
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:55,503
That's what you thought.

1081
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:59,757
Well, since you're such a gay dog,

1082
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:02,760
you'd better take me to the
midway tonight for a little fun.

1083
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:06,264
- No, Ma, you're all tired out.
- Who said I was tired?

1084
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,767
Say. Here's something interesting.

1085
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:12,520
It's about that judge, the fella
that gave you the plaque.

1086
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:17,943
It says here how he had a kind of seizure
afterwards, delirium tremens sort of.

1087
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,613
"While Mr. Hippenstahl
was unconscious,

1088
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,613
"he kept murmuring
something about mincemeat.

1089
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:29,618
"Those nearby declared they could
smell brandy on his breath."

1090
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,834
You fool.

1091
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,220
Now, just for that,
you've got to take me out.

1092
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,346
Oh, no, Ma.

1093
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:48,640
I've got that nice
tired-out feeling.

1094
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:51,476
- You and I are going to the fair.
- I've seen the fair.

1095
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:54,229
You've seen the hog pavilion.

1096
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,232
Are you going
to get out of that chair?

1097
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,817
Now, Ma, I'm up.

1098
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,820
Now go on in and change
your clothes. Go on.

1099
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,318
I want some excitement.

1100
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:24,467
I can hear 'em calling hogs
in the clear Ioway air

1101
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:28,721
I can sniff the fragrant
whiff of an Ioway rose

1102
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,015
You've got Ioway in your heart

1103
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,518
I've got Ioway in my hair

1104
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:37,021
I've got Ioway in my ears
and eyes and nose

1105
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,400
Oh, I know all I owe

1106
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:42,944
I owe Ioway

1107
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:47,407
I owe Ioway all I owe
and I know why

1108
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:49,701
I am Ioway born and bred

1109
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,078
And on Ioway corn I'm fed

1110
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:56,582
Not to mention
her barley, wheat and rye

1111
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:59,043
I owe Ioway for her ham

1112
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,379
And her beef and her lamb

1113
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,756
And her strawberry jam

1114
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,925
And her pie

1115
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:10,513
I owe Ioway more
than I can ever pay

1116
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:15,310
So I think
I'll move to Calif om-i-ay

1117
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,812
- What a shame
- What a shame

1118
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,106
- What a shame
- What a shame

1119
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:23,443
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry when you go

1120
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:27,071
- Don't I know
- When you leave your native state

1121
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,532
You'll be feeling far from great

1122
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:34,330
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry when you go

1123
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:38,541
I'm a seed

1124
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,044
Of Ioway grain

1125
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,212
You're a breeze

1126
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:45,882
That Ioway blew

1127
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:48,134
I'm a drop

1128
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:50,636
Of Ioway rain

1129
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:54,341
You're a drip of Ioway dew

1130
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,769
Oh, I know all I owe

1131
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,355
I owe Ioway

1132
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:05,109
- I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why
- Ioway

1133
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,445
I am Ioway born and bred

1134
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,572
And on Ioway corn I'm fed

1135
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:14,285
Not to mention
her barley, wheat and rye

1136
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,746
I owe Ioway for her ham

1137
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:18,956
And her beef and her lamb

1138
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,417
And her strawberry jam

1139
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:22,794
And her pie

1140
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:23,920
That's right.

1141
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:28,257
I owe Ioway more
than anyone should owe

1142
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:31,719
So I think I'll start
in owing Idaho

1143
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,054
All together.

1144
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,556
- What a shame
- What a shame

1145
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,892
- What a shame
- What a shame

1146
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:42,647
- You'll be crying like a baby when you go
- Don't I know

1147
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,816
When I leave my native heath

1148
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,276
With my lip between my teeth

1149
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:52,199
I'll be bawling like a booby
when I go

1150
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,452
You're a seed

1151
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,913
Of Ioway grain

1152
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,165
You're a breeze

1153
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,835
That Ioway blew

1154
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,920
I'm a drop

1155
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,506
Of Ioway rain

1156
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,591
You're a drip

1157
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,136
Of Ioway dew

1158
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,185
Oh, I know all I owe

1159
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:23,271
- I owe Ioway
- I owe Ioway

1160
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:27,358
- I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why
- I owe Ioway

1161
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,362
I am Ioway born and bred
and on Ioway corn I'm fed

1162
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:35,533
- Not to mention her barley, wheat and rye
- Barley, wheat and rye

1163
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:37,702
I owe Ioway for her ham

1164
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,871
And her beef and her lamb

1165
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:43,708
- And her strawberry jam and her pie
- Pie, pie, pie, pie

1166
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:47,879
- I owe Ioway more than anyone should owe
- Oh

1167
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:52,049
So I think I'll start
in owing Idaho

1168
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,218
Better stay

1169
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,429
Better stay

1170
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,723
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry if you go

1171
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:00,224
Don't I know

1172
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,477
When you leave your native state

1173
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,645
You'll be feeling far from great

1174
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:11,695
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry when you go

1175
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,493
I owe Ioway for her ham
and her beef and her lamb

1176
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:21,954
And her strawberry jam and her pie

1177
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:25,833
I owe Ioway more
than I can ever pay

1178
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,419
So I think I'll move
to Californ-i-ay

1179
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:32,798
I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W-A!

1180
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:36,879
Hooray! Ioway! Yea!

1181
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,438
What do you think of this
imitation champagne, Ma?

1182
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,149
First time I ever tried it,
and I love it.

1183
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,443
It's as good as that
French champagne any day.

1184
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:55,818
- Did you ever taste French champagne?
- No.

1185
01:23:58,825 --> 01:23:59,951
Who's that little runt?

1186
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:02,450
- Hmm?
- What's he grinning at?

1187
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:13,172
That's Mr. Hippenstahl,
the pickle and mincemeat judge.

1188
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,550
Oh. Oh!

1189
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:18,302
Well, that explains it. He's drunk!

1190
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:21,430
- Quiet, Pa.
- Come on, Ma.

1191
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,555
- Let's get out on the midway.
- All right.

1192
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:32,984
Hey, buddy! I wanna thank you for the
plug you gave that song last night.

1193
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:36,654
It's all set with Tommy Thomas for Emily
to sing it in Chicago tomorrow night.

1194
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,531
- Chicago?
- Yeah. That's their next date,

1195
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:40,074
the Palmer House.

1196
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,159
I'm going with them
on the plane tonight.

1197
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,829
Sticking close so they
won't change their mind.

1198
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,249
Emily didn't say she was... I didn't
figure on them leaving tonight.

1199
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,419
Sure, right after the show.

1200
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,922
I wish she'd hurry up and get
out here. I wanna talk to her.

1201
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:58,009
Kind of went overboard for
each other, didn't you, kid?

1202
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:00,678
- Kind of.
- She told me.

1203
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:03,681
Oh, they all tell me everything.

1204
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:07,184
- You going back to the farm soon?
- Tomorrow.

1205
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:10,514
That'll be good.

1206
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,941
Come in.

1207
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,901
- Oh, hello.
- I was just on my way out.

1208
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,363
- I'll say you are. Where's your suitcase?
- Suitcase? What for?

1209
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:23,242
The old man just phoned from Chicago.
He's gonna give you a crack at that job.

1210
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:26,537
- The Eastern syndicate?
- That's right. A column of your own.

1211
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:29,206
- I can't believe it.
- He's leaving for the coast in the morning

1212
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,959
and he wants you to fly up to
Chicago and talk to him tonight.

1213
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,420
- That means the 8:30 plane.
- How much time have I got?

1214
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:37,921
Practically none. I'm holding a taxi
downstairs. I'll get your shaving things.

1215
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,763
- Hey, wait!
- What's the matter?

1216
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:46,891
I can't leave now. I've got a girl
waiting for me out at the fair.

1217
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,560
- What'll I do?
- Do? Get another girl in Chicago.

1218
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,771
A girl waiting at the fair.

1219
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:55,441
I break my neck getting this chance for you
and you start yapping about some girl.

1220
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:58,611
- This is different. This is not just a girl.
- I know. She's wonderful.

1221
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:01,906
Only girl in the world. And I
suppose this job is just a job.

1222
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:03,991
The kind that comes up every day.

1223
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,952
Look, I wanna make something
very clear to you, sonny-boy.

1224
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:08,454
The old man is funny.

1225
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:11,248
When he wants you someplace,
you better, or you're through.

1226
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:13,959
- I know that, but...
- Do you want this job or don't you?

1227
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:17,414
You've got about two minutes
to make up your mind.

1228
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,087
Thank you very much.

1229
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:25,763
- What did she say?
- She sees a lot of money coming my way.

1230
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:30,142
- Good. I can use some.
- I don't think it'll do you much good.

1231
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:33,979
She says I'm going
to marry three times.

1232
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,065
There they are, folks,

1233
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:38,401
the eight fugitives
from the Follies.

1234
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:41,946
They did a little dance in New York,
but the police commissioner objected.

1235
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:45,324
He demanded that they take
certain things out of the dance.

1236
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:49,120
Understand? Well, rather than
do the emasculated version,

1237
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:54,125
they come out here to give you the
original dance with nothing cut out.

1238
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:57,920
Just to prove to you what you're
gonna see on the inside...

1239
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:00,297
Okay, Mike, let her rip!

1240
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:24,488
- Do you want to go in?
- Huh?

1241
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,408
It means nothing to me,
but if you'd like to see it,

1242
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:30,783
I'd be glad to take you in, hmm?

1243
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:33,865
Hmm?

1244
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:50,556
What do you think?
Of course, like I say,

1245
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:53,976
it means nothing to me
unless you wanna go in.

1246
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,271
You do? Come on.

1247
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,564
Two, please.

1248
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:03,486
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, we are.

1249
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:04,734
That's good.

1250
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:09,617
What's that old buzzard
doing, following you around?

1251
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:14,699
Don't be foolish, Abel. He's seeing
the fair, having fun, same as we are.

1252
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:17,500
All aboard. Train now leaving.

1253
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:21,670
Get tickets for this ride.
Another train coming in.

1254
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:26,175
Get your tickets for that high,
fast ride through the sky,

1255
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:29,136
on the big roller coaster

1256
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:32,762
the big feature ride of the fair.

1257
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:37,895
But last night and all the things
we said, was that just kidding?

1258
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:41,106
No, Wayne, it wasn't just kidding.

1259
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:44,777
Well, it certainly wasn't with me.
I thought that...

1260
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:48,614
Oh, what's the difference
what I thought?

1261
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:52,409
But, Wayne, darling, I thought
you understood that...

1262
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,496
Well, after all, we were just
two people who met at a fair...

1263
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:57,039
And fell in love, didn't we?

1264
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,288
Well, that was something
I hadn't bargained for.

1265
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:03,581
Wayne, will you believe something?
Just one thing.

1266
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:07,758
It's every bit as hard for me
to give you up as it is for...

1267
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:11,595
Well, then why do it?
Why give each other up?

1268
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:12,930
Why don't you come with me,

1269
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:14,890
meet my father and mother
and go home with us tomorrow?

1270
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:19,103
- Because I can't, Wayne. I...
- Hey, Emily.

1271
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,932
- You ready?
- No, she isn't!

1272
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,646
I'll be right in, Marty.

1273
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,777
Wait here, Wayne.
I have to tell you something,

1274
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:33,450
something I should have
told you before,

1275
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:37,747
and I would have, if I
hadn't been such a coward.

1276
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,876
Please, wait, Wayne. Please.

1277
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:00,766
You mind if I say something?

1278
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,854
- Such as what?
- First, let me get something straight.

1279
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:09,528
When you said that about
taking Emily home with you,

1280
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:12,698
did you mean the works,
a wedding ring and all?

1281
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:16,153
That's it, the works. And
that's the way it's gonna be.

1282
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:20,248
Look, I'll give it to you quick.

1283
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:24,495
She's married.
She's got a husband, see?

1284
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:28,005
He don't work at it very hard.

1285
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:30,674
They split up about a year ago.

1286
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:33,844
He claims he's a songwriter,
but he's just no good at it.

1287
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:37,390
As a matter of fact,
he's just no good, period.

1288
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:46,775
She liked him, though. Sort of
knocked her out for a while.

1289
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:51,105
Come to think of it, you're the first
guy she's looked at since then.

1290
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:55,699
I guess I just don't understand
the people in your business.

1291
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,369
Take my word, they're the
same as anybody else.

1292
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:01,789
They make mistakes, sure,
but don't everybody?

1293
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:04,584
Are all the people
in your town perfect?

1294
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,169
Why didn't she tell me?

1295
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,838
She told you why.

1296
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:12,292
She didn't want
to spoil everything.

1297
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:16,388
Maybe she figured she had a right
to a little happiness too.

1298
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:23,102
You know what you and me
need right now?

1299
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:24,429
A drink.

1300
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,274
How about it, buddy?

1301
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,317
Ring the old pipe!

1302
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:35,447
There she goes. 47! He's
getting higher and higher!

1303
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:39,535
48! Who's next?

1304
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:42,955
Not bad. Not bad at all, Mr. Frake.

1305
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:45,124
Not bad, huh? Thank you.

1306
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:47,960
But you didn't ring the bell,
though. Ho, ho, ho.

1307
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:50,546
I know I didn't ring the
bell, though. Ho, ho, ho.

1308
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:53,590
- Who can? Can you?
- I don't know. I never tried.

1309
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:56,427
- Why don't you?
- I don't know, but I will.

1310
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:59,930
Step right up, neighbor.
Step right up.

1311
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:02,766
- It's kind of heavy, isn't it?
- Allow me.

1312
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,103
Thank you.

1313
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:08,939
Now, I suppose the idea is
to lean your weight on it.

1314
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:14,611
Yes. Put all your 120 pounds in it.

1315
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,828
Come on, Ma. I'm tired.
Let's go home.

1316
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,749
I suppose it's too late to stop
someplace for a cup of coffee.

1317
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,998
Who said it was too late?

1318
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:43,640
- Easy does it, pal. Easy does it.
- I'm okay.

1319
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,893
Sure, you are.

1320
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:49,938
What about this Eleanor,
the girl from back home?

1321
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:52,483
You say you graduated
from school together, huh?

1322
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:56,111
Yep. She's a fine girl too.

1323
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:58,322
What does she look like, redhead?

1324
01:32:58,323 --> 01:33:02,326
- Nope. Blond.
- Oh. I like the redheads.

1325
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:05,746
There's a redhead
lives on the floor below me.

1326
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,373
What a dish! I keep thinking,

1327
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:13,003
I'll get off the elevator at the
wrong floor, but I never do.

1328
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:14,505
Why not? Why don't you?

1329
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:18,131
And have my wife make
a cripple out of me for life?

1330
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:24,014
One shoe off,
and the other shoe off.

1331
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:29,061
Diddle, diddle, dumpling
my son John

1332
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:32,022
Hey, that don't rhyme
like it used to.

1333
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:35,359
Did I ever tell you about Eleanor?
She's a girl I went to school with.

1334
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,778
- Yes. I know. I know.
- Wonderful!

1335
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:41,404
Just the girl for you.
Wonderful girl.

1336
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,256
Look, bobbylocks,
don't worry about me.

1337
01:33:57,257 --> 01:34:01,883
Anytime I want to throw in the sponge,
you'll know it. I just won't be around.

1338
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:02,821
- You about ready?
- Yes. See you next year.

1339
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:05,282
Yes, indeed. We'll be here.
Take good care of yourself.

1340
01:35:05,283 --> 01:35:06,783
We will.

1341
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:08,531
All right, son, get aboard.

1342
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:16,119
- Bye!
- Bye!

1343
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:24,801
I can't remember when
I've been as tired.

1344
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:26,845
It's that resting
you did at the fair, Ma.

1345
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:29,469
Three days' rest
will tire anybody out.

1346
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:33,685
- Good-bye, Hank!
- Good-bye, Frake! See you next year.

1347
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:34,933
You bet.

1348
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:57,793
For goodness sake,
what's the matter, Margy?

1349
01:35:57,794 --> 01:36:00,629
You're crying like there was
never gonna be another fair.

1350
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:02,756
We'll be back next year.

1351
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:07,511
- I never want to see another fair.
- You can say that again.

1352
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,429
You meet a lot of people
who play you for a sucker

1353
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:11,431
and have some laughs
at your expense.

1354
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:13,851
When the fair's over, what?

1355
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,603
Just chalk it up to
experience, I guess.

1356
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:20,190
Sure, that's why you go
to a fair, experience.

1357
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:22,359
Something new, different.

1358
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:26,863
Yes, sir, the Frakes are
coming home in grand style.

1359
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:29,449
You got your plaque,
I got the grand award,

1360
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:33,412
we're all well and happy, and
Dave Miller owes me five bucks.

1361
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:43,171
There you are. That's Melissa's
plaque for mincemeat.

1362
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:46,758
And this is mine. First prize
for the best boar in the state.

1363
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:50,095
So, you see, Gloomy Gus,
you lost your bet.

1364
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:53,098
Nobody got sick and nothing
bad happened to any of us.

1365
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:56,560
Only thing is, something might have
happened we don't know about.

1366
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:59,605
None of that now.
Come across. $5.00.

1367
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:04,401
- Lemonade, Mr. Miller?
- Yes!

1368
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:08,238
Thank you, Mrs. Frake.
Believe I will.

1369
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:11,325
Would have done your heart good
to hear 'em in church this morning.

1370
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:15,037
Everybody talking about the Frakes
and all the prizes you won.

1371
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:17,414
Well, that's nice.

1372
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:20,834
See you later. I won't
be home for dinner.

1373
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:23,670
- All right, son.
- Where are you going?

1374
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,623
Oh, just for a little drive.

1375
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:32,304
Did Wayne have a good time?
He looks a little down.

1376
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:34,556
Had the time of his life,
far as I can make out.

1377
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:35,932
Mr. Miller. Abel?

1378
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:37,806
No, not now, Ma.

1379
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:43,145
Headache better, dear?

1380
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:50,614
How about you, Margy?

1381
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:53,116
Did you have
a good time at the fair?

1382
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,872
Answer that, Margy.

1383
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:01,826
It's probably Harry for you.

1384
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:05,796
Well, go on, dear.
Don't let it ring all day.

1385
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:15,973
- Well?
- Let's not be hasty about this now.

1386
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:19,434
Hello?

1387
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:22,562
Doesn't anybody ever answer
the telephone at your house?

1388
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:25,857
Pat! Oh, Pat!

1389
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:28,152
Here? In Brunswick?

1390
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:33,198
Oh, yes. Yes, I do. I do, Pat!

1391
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:36,868
That's all I wanna know. 'Cause
you're going back to Chicago with me.

1392
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,954
You're gonna be the wife
of a columnist.

1393
01:38:38,955 --> 01:38:41,456
Yeah. How do I drive
out to your place?

1394
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:46,128
Where are you now? Is your car pointed
toward the hotel or the Elk's hall?

1395
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:48,547
Well, get in and keep it
going in that direction.

1396
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:52,050
Just keep going until you see me.
Oh, yes, and hurry!

1397
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:54,379
Hurry! Hurry.

1398
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:58,682
Margy, you didn't
answer my question.

1399
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,809
Did you have
a good time at the fair?

1400
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:06,106
Oh, yes, Mr. Miller! It was the most
wonderful fair in the whole world!

1401
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:07,399
There!

1402
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,982
You see? What did I tell you?

1403
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:14,361
Margy! Margy!
That's Mr. Miller's car!

1404
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:19,494
Well!

1405
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,572
She'll be right back, I'm sure.

1406
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:25,075
$5.00.

1407
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:50,021
Oh, Pat!

1408
01:39:51,444 --> 01:39:53,904
Hi!

1409
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:55,197
Hi!

1410
01:39:56,991 --> 01:40:01,161
It's a grand night for singing

1411
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:04,873
The stars are bright above

1412
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:08,627
The earth is aglow and
to add to the show

1413
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:12,506
I think I am falling in love

1414
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:14,591
Falling

1415
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:18,092
Falling in love
