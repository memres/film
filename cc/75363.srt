3
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:42,742
Newspaper.

5
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:49,657
- Is it true? 
- Look yourself, sir.

7
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:56,623
"Following the success of our U-boats it has been decided ..."

9
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:00,667
So now we know, sir.

10
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,188
Reception!

11
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,275
- ... I want a room 
- A room for my wife and myself.

12
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:10,081
Sorry, we are full.

13
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:13,716
- But we just got married. 
- He has to join the ship tomorrow!

15
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,724
29, but I might turn you out.

16
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,890
Register first!

17
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:22,726
¿Captain Hardt?

18
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,046
You'll need a diving suit. He is still at sea.

19
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:31,538
- The U29 moored an hour ago, sir. 
- Who would be a U-boat captain?

20
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,370
- A letter arrives, send it to my room. 
- Very good.

21
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:38,934
- Capt Rigg wants another manicure, room 46. 
- I know...

22
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:41,335
Well?

23
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:43,783
Captain Hardt is to report to headquarters immediately.

24
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,020
- He hasn't arrived yet. 
- What's his room number?

25
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,624
- 54 
- Have you seen him?

26
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,861
Not for 16 days.

27
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:59,190
- You know him by sight?
- No.

28
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,591
Well, try the Turkish baths at Koernische.

29
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:03,640
Koernische Strasse ...

30
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:08,559
- Hullo; kept my room? 
- 54, Captain Hardt.

31
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:10,559
- Cigarettes? 
- Sorry, Capt. We're sold out.

32
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,367
- Again? 
- Got yet tobacco.

33
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:15,809
And a beautiful pipe. Only six marks.

34
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:18,807
Nothing doing it. I never smoke a pipe.

35
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:22,213
- C'mon, lets bath and shape the body. 
- Did you sink any food ships?

36
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,687
- Four. 
- Makes me hungry just to think of it.

37
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:37,682
16 days without a smoke.

38
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,848
- This is absolutely ... 
- Perfect!

39
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:44,930
Food first. A cigar is best after dinner.

40
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:46,443
You're always right, sir.

41
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,374
Back again, Captain. Congratulations.

42
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,660
- A table for two? 
- And a meal for ten.

43
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,260
I put in the out booth. They've just gone.

44
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,866
- Felix, darling! 
- After dinner, Schatzchen.

45
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:14,690
Listen Hans: We've been 16 days in a submarine.

46
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:20,178
It makes 48 tins of sardines, 768 beastly little fishes.

47
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,152
- I could eat a horse.
- He probably did.

48
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,717
Sorry, it's a meatless day.

49
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:29,996
We'll have roast goose with foie gras,

50
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:33,845
- Apple pie, plum pudding. 
- Big as a depth charge.

51
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,963
Gentlemen... please!

52
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,086
- Here is the menu. 
- Thank you.

53
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:43,687
- Is it a joke? 
- Boiled fish!

54
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,452
- Carrots, beets, potatoes. 
- No potatoes, sir!

55
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,840
- Bring a pail of bread and butter. 
- No butter. Margarine tomorrow perhaps.

56
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:55,614
We sank the finest food in the world

57
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,764
Then turn to port and you give us ...

58
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:01,299
- Boiled fish and carrots! 
- I agree...

59
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,127
Fifth floor.

60
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:53,944
Captain Hardt? Message from
headquarters. Report immediately.

61
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,751
- Carry on as she goes, quartermaster. 
- As she goes, sir.

62
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:18,124
What an idea, putting a 
motorbike in a submarine!

63
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:20,005
11:15, sir.

64
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:25,570
- 11:14. 
- Can at least open the kit pack?

65
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:29,290
11:15, sir.

66
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:34,291
11:15, gentlemen.

68
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,952
What it says about the motorbike, sir?

69
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,876
- What you got there? 
- A chart of the mine defences.

70
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:10,754
And a photograph of the Old Man of Hoy;
it seems to be a rendez-vous.

71
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,765
3* 25'. It's off my chart.

72
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,365
- It's in mine. 
- Here.

73
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:23,728
Gentlemen, we are on a special mission.

74
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:28,809
Our orders are to proceed to
Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands.

75
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:34,175
It's a big job and a dangerous one. 
I know I can count on you.

76
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:36,494
That's all. Thank you.

77
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,742
Hartman, full speed ahead.

78
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:42,864
- 3-2-0. 
- 3-2-0, sir.

79
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,143
- Schuster? 
- Yes, sir.

80
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,270
"Your" motorbike, it'll take me to Longhope,

81
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:52,474
in the island of Hoy, base
of the British Grand Fleet.

82
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:57,674
"Once across the minefield,
spend the night at the Man of Hoy."

83
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,152
Lt. Schuster will take over
and wait for your return.

84
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:05,637
You will proceed to the Longhope School

85
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:10,678
where you will report to our agent... 
Fraulein Thiel. "

86
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,249
A woman? How is she?

87
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,687
- Tall, dark, 21... 
- My type, sir!

88
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:18,570
- Have a shave, sir. 
- See what's in the kit pack.

89
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,931
- I still do not see why a motorcycle. 
- Schuster ...

90
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:25,996
A man landed from a submarine
would not travel by motorbike.

91
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,773
- Ah, camouflage! 
- Ah, camouflage.

92
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:31,659
A well-worn tweed, the thing for Scotland.

93
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:34,545
Too big for me; fits you all right.

94
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:38,544
This suit's mine! I bought it in Berlin.

95
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:45,105
"Temple & Conway, Saville Row, London"

96
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:48,787
"Ernest H-A-R-T"

97
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:51,393
Your name, sir, spelled in the English way.

98
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,516
Clever. Stole my own suit. 
Trying to make a spy of me.

99
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:58,960
This Fraulein Thiel; is there
a photograph of her?

100
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,843
- How would they get her into the school? 
- That's their business.

101
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,689
Miss Anne, dear, it is nearly four.

102
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:15,849
- The carrier will be here. 
- Coming!

103
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:18,291
Look out!

104
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,294
- My poor paint... 
- The handle broke.

105
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,777
Oh, there's nothing hurt.

106
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,223
Nanny dear, I've loved my holiday, every minute.

107
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:31,940
How couldn't I know to look after your? 
I have plenty of practice.

108
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:35,707
Don't stand there smiling, fix a label.

109
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:37,586
I thought you might like to have this.

110
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:41,590
You dropped your passport, Miss Butter Fingers.

111
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:44,716
- It's a photo of John and me. 
- And you give it to me?

112
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:47,678
- I have lots more. They printed thousands. 
- Beautiful!

113
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:52,112
"Rvd. John Harris, vicar of St. Swithin's,"

114
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,958
"and his fiancee, Miss Anne Burnett,"

115
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:59,919
"who was appointed to the
school at Orkney Islands..."

116
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:04,644
- You'll miss him, deary. 
- Oh, he's going come see
me when he got a leave.

117
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:12,374
A car has stopped at the gate!

118
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:24,904
Would it be too much to ask for some tea?

119
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:29,230
It suits me, but you'll have to wait until
this lady is under way. Maggie, the bag.

120
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:33,831
- We're waiting for the carrier. 
- To take the train to Thurston. Excuse me a minute.

121
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:36,191
- Are you going up north? 
- To the Orkney Islands.

122
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:38,667
- Where the fleet is, right? 
- Got a job there. I'm a teacher.

123
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,069
- It's four o'clock! 
- My train leaves at five!

124
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,951
How strange Sandy Ross being late. 

125
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,354
- Sandy Ross?
- Have you seen him?

126
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:51,356
We saw an old car with his name. 
He seemed to be broken down.

127
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,007
- Where? 
- About 8 km.

128
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:56,448
- God! 
- Can't catch another train?

129
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:59,650
Missing the boat would mean losing a whole day!

130
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:02,454
Tell Mr. McLeod! We'll take the hearse.

131
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:03,810
No. Wait.

132
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:06,891
- I can run you to the station. 
- It would be lovely.

133
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,652
- What about your tea? 
- It doesn't matter.

134
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,132
- The Providence sent you. 
- Come along.

135
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:14,579
Maggie, put her things in the car!

136
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:16,303
We're taking her to Dingwall.

137
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:20,427
Be sure to keep warm. She's easy to catch a cold!

138
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,785
You're a blessing in disguise.

139
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,504
Hold your dear passport. Don't forget your woolies.

140
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:28,665
- It's terribly cold out there. 
- I'll take care.

141
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,436
- Never thought you were a teacher. 
- But I am.

142
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:47,283
- I got my degree from Bristol U. 
- Then again...

143
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:51,121
Had to do something after my father died. No money.

144
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,491
- What was your father? 
- He was an architect, but not very lucky.

145
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:57,375
He only had a good job; a tavern in Chester.

146
00:11:57,536 --> 00:11:59,971
And he didn't like it because he was a teetotaler.

147
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:04,091
- You lived in Chester? 
- Yes, on Putnam Street.

148
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:08,897
- The Orkney Islands; do you have friends there? 
- None.

149
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:12,339
- But John will come to see me. 
- Who is John?

150
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:15,349
My fiance. Want to see a photograph?

151
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:16,704
Very much.

152
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,510
He is quite good looking.

153
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:25,589
Orkney Islands; I thought it was
impossible for civilians to go there.

154
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:28,556
It is. It was a fuzz getting my passport.

155
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:32,077
- But you got it? 
- Yes, here it is.

156
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:35,681
Complete with photograph. Isn't it terrible?

157
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:43,719
- Passport photographs are never flattering. 
- Haven't you taken the wrong road?

158
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,682
- ¿Is this the route to Dingwall, Edwards?
- Yes, madam.

159
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:48,844
It probably is a shortcut.

160
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,930
- Are you sure you aren't cold? 
- No, I love it.

161
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:56,729
Remember what your nanny said. 
Give Miss Burnett the shetland scarf.

162
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:07,623
- Really I don't want it. 
- No, you mustn't catch cold.

163
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:21,428
- Done? 
- All is in order.

164
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:23,795
Well, hold on tight.

165
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:43,413
Put on these clothes.

166
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:23,520
- Did you see a light? 
- Where? No.

167
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:29,366
- I think I heard a splash. 
- Take over.

168
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,762
A seagull.

169
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:03,746
Right, madam. We know you.

170
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,791
- ¿Miss Anne Burnett? 
- Yes.

171
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,360
- Schoolteacher?
- Yes.

172
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:19,593
- This picture, it doesn't really do you justice. 
- I tought it as good as my other passport photos.

173
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,205
- Destination?
- Longhope.

174
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:23,245
- Age?
- 21.

175
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,128
- Married or single? 
- Engaged.

176
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:27,883
- Pass... 
- Thank you.

177
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,811
- What about tea, Miss? 
- Yes, please.

178
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:45,099
- What time we get to Longhope?
 - In about an hour, Miss.

179
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:49,179
- You're only passenger 'cept for a telephone linesman.
- Thank you.

180
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:03,831
Fix your pass there.

181
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:06,795
- Are you in the wire patrol? 
- What do you think?

182
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,473
- Six? 
- Six.

183
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,994
I'll pass you.

184
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:18,367
- Fine passage, James? 
- You think so, Walter?

185
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:23,043
For you. All you do is stand on the bridge, but me?

186
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:26,406
It is a miracle that I keep this old tub coming.

187
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:31,527
When will we be in port to see them?

188
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:35,058
- I'll see about that.
- I hope so.

189
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,094
- You're the new teacher?
- Yes.

190
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:41,337
It'll be a nice change from the last one. 
She was called "Wall Eyed Maggie".

191
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,337
- You got a pass?
- Yes.

192
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:46,147
I'm a special constable, you understand?

193
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:48,744
See that? "Orkney Constabulary", for the duration.

194
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,870
No one's up or down without me knowing.

195
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,389
- Miss Anne Burnett?
- Yes.

196
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:56,234
I'll pass you.

197
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:59,834
Bob Bratt. Come; there's a minister
and his wife who want to meet you.

198
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:02,070
- Thank you.
- I'll take it.

199
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:13,519
- Shut that door!
- All right, Pier Master!

200
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:15,999
This is Rvd. Hector Matthews. My wife.

201
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,367
- How kind to meet me.
- Welcome to Longhope.

202
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:22,085
We were thinking, you may prefer a room with us

203
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:25,090
- To living up at the school house.
- That's very kind, but ...

204
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:29,299
We thought it'd be highly improper
for so young a girl to be on her own.

205
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,661
- I'm accustomed to look after myself.
- Mrs Matthews is a pretty housekeeper.

206
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:37,138
- You'll find the charge is very reasonable.
- I'm sure of that.

207
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,220
Shall we discuss it some other time?
Good bye.

208
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,546
- Good bye.
- I'll put you on your road, Miss Burnett.

209
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,067
- Shut that door!
- All right, Pier Master!

212
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,613
- 50 feet.
- Pump up 4 auxiliary.

213
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:22,578
Pump up 4 auxiliary!

214
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:31,860
- Dead slow.
- Dead slow, sir.

215
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:34,378
Stop the pump. Shut 4 auxiliary.

216
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,425
Stop the pump, shut 4 auxiliary!

218
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:50,709
- 80 feet!
- Flood fives.

219
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,476
Flood fives!

220
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:04,441
Hold at 80 feet.

221
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:18,094
Hot? Funny how cold makes you steam.

222
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:24,375
- We have scraped something, have you heard?
- You would have heard if we had.

223
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,712
Well, gentlemen, I think we are through.

224
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,596
Whoever got the chart of the mine
field deserves the Iron Cross.

225
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:44,148
Yes, we shouldn't have even
a wood one without it.

226
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,519
Stop motors.

227
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:49,471
Stopped boat, sir!

228
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,716
Can you hear anything?

229
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:58,727
No, sir. Nothing.

230
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,406
- Good. I'm going up. 30 feet.
- 30 feet, sir!

231
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:03,052
Up periscope.

232
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:09,332
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface!

233
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:14,094
- Main vents shut, sir!
- Blow ones.

234
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,383
- Blow twos and threes.
- Blow twos and threes!

235
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:22,985
25...

236
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,029
20...

237
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:30,863
- 15 ...
- Stop blowing. Exit stations!

238
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:47,645
- We review the details?
- Do you think I'll forget?

239
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,158
To be sure. Ready? On top of the cliff?

240
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,564
- Northeast, surrounding rocks.
- Then?

241
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:57,531
Follow telegraph poles. Rough road.

242
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:59,606
- 3 miles?
- Right.

243
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,416
At the fork, turn left.

244
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:05,935
- In the cairn?
- Stop and look for the sign W-NW.

245
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,693
- The woman?
- Fraulein Thiel.

246
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,502
- Motorcycle is asshore, sir.
- Password?

247
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:13,584
I do not know what spell makes me so sad...

248
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:19,619
- What are you smiling at?
- You sir, saying that in the dark to a woman.

249
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,907
If you are so funny, keep it. Come on.

250
00:21:26,474 --> 00:21:28,865
Come up at same time next 3 nights.

251
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:30,231
Yes, sir.

252
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:33,029
- Got everything you want?
- Yes.

253
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,201
- Glasses? ¿Gun?
- All.

254
00:21:36,402 --> 00:21:37,836
Good luck.

255
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:33,966
Who goes there?

256
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:42,814
- Constable Bob Bratt.
- Pass.

257
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:46,326
Quiet tonight.

258
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:12,249
Hi there!

259
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:27,025
Put that light out!

260
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,384
- Is somebody calling?
- What you think you're doing showing a naked light?

261
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:34,549
- I'm very sorry.
- Put it out!

262
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:35,988
Yes.

263
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,594
- Haven't you read the regulations?
- No.

264
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:50,159
- All the worse. And you're a teacher!
- It's you, Mr. Bratt? I'm very sorry.

265
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:52,198
Well, that's all right, Miss.

266
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:56,203
I'm single handed and the fleet here, I have to keep an eye.

267
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:00,888
A spy would give his head to get here,
but he won't get by Bob Bratt.

268
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:03,085
- Good night.
- Good night.

269
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:30,595
I do not know what spell makes me so sad.

270
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:35,553
An ancient legend duped me and not let me.

271
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:55,044
- What was the patrol doing?
- They saw the light.

272
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:58,729
- You're alone?
- Of course.

273
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:03,216
- Where this door leads?
- To the kitchen.

274
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:19,911
- Does the ladder?
- A room.

275
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:36,722
Butter!

276
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,687
You gave me a fright.

277
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:46,808
So you are Fraulein Thiel.

278
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:48,489
Yes, captain Hardt.

279
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:55,049
- From now on please speak in English.
- And eat in English?

280
00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:57,373
- Come in.
- Thank you.

281
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:06,738
- How did you get here?
- A demure look and a fake passport.

282
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,791
You speak English like a native.

283
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:12,946
I shouldn't go very far. I am the teacher.

284
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:15,835
- Teacher!
- My name is Anne Burnett.

285
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:18,671
- Please call me that.
- Anne Burnett.

286
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,597
Are you mad? Wearing an uniform here?

287
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:28,764
If I'm shot, it will be as an officer, not a spy.

288
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:32,408
Being a civilian I have no such defenses.

289
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,807
I beg your pardon.

290
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:43,452
A whole ham, white bread... and butter.

291
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:45,888
- Butter!
- Butter.

292
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:48,768
These English are not feeling the pinch.

293
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:09,192
I had no idea secret agent's was such a comfortable profession.

294
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:12,438
It has its uncomfortable moments.

295
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:16,155
Talking about it, school opens the day after tomorrow.

296
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:20,355
- I wonder how I should get on.
- So do I.

297
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:27,799
In Germany girls no longer wear silk stockings.

298
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,286
I'll show you your room. It's upstairs.

299
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:36,926
- I haven't yet been told what I'm to do here.
- You'll be told tomorrow.

300
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:41,291
Not tomorrow. Now!

301
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,851
What are your orders?

302
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:52,023
- I beg your pardon?
- Your orders, Captain Hardt!

303
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:56,179
To report for duty to Fraulein Thiel and obey her orders.

304
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,107
Exactly! Pick up your motorbike and go to bed.

305
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:09,878
- Do I take it to bed with me?
- Suit yourself. There's a parking space at the wash den.

306
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:20,126
Sorry.

307
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,603
Good night.

308
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:36,572
Hey, hey! Why are you locking me in?

309
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:42,057
- A woman comes to clean in the morning.
- I can lock my own door.

310
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:44,341
I think this is safer.

311
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:03,537
- May I come in?
- Come in.

312
00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:07,654
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

313
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:10,817
Your breakfast is in my room. 
There's a beautiful view from my window.

314
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:15,220
I didn't come here for holidays. I have more 
important things to do than admire the view.

315
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,749
All right!

316
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:10,059
Well... ¿The plan?

317
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:13,944
To sink 15 of these ships.

318
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:16,546
How?

319
00:32:17,314 --> 00:32:19,192
He will tell you.

320
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,793
Who is he?

321
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:31,600
A British officer with a grudge. 
He was in command of a destroyer.

322
00:32:31,764 --> 00:32:34,326
- He lost it in a collision.
- How?

323
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:36,803
A wrong order. He'd been drinking.

324
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:41,010
Traitor and drunkard, an honor for the British navy.

325
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:44,772
- Where did this happen?
- Off Cyprus.

326
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:49,896
- HMS Connaught. February 16.
- Then you knew?

327
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:54,293
- Of course. Commander Ashington.
- Lieutenant. He was dismissed of the ship.

328
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:59,538
- Where did you meet him?
 - At Leith, a month ago.

329
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:03,218
- And found he had a price.
- Rather a high one.

330
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:06,822
- Paid by whom? 
- Germany.

331
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:09,502
Only by Germany?

332
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:11,826
And me.

333
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:16,748
I suppose we should have to meet.

334
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:18,716
Come down in a minute.

335
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:24,272
Captain Hardt.

336
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:29,002
Suppose we'll sit down and get acquainted.

337
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:35,087
- Give him a drink; loosen him up a bit.
- I'd rather get to business.

338
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,449
Drink when you can in this job. That's my motto.

339
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:41,888
May we confine on what rests before us.

340
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:47,448
All alike, you Germans, one tech mind.

341
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,254
Draw the curtains, get the charts. Let's go.

342
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:56,616
Here we are. Three years we've been sitting on our bottoms in Keith.

343
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,428
- Met in Jutland.
- That's why you haven't put it out a notice since.

344
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:01,946
- You mean ... 
- All right, we both won.

345
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:04,627
Point is: with the fleet around the corner,

346
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,867
and that the large fleet in Scapa watching,

347
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:12,874
- You couldn't get to the Irish Channel...
- I know that. What's your plan?

348
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:19,796
Two cruisers squadrons will sweep southward.

349
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:22,434
I know that too. It is routine.

350
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:28,087
But wouldn't you give an eye to know when, where & how?

351
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,007
- Do you know?
- Everything except the actual time, and I'll get it.

352
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:33,971
- Which squads? 
- The 1st and 5th.

353
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:35,854
And the course?

354
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:42,057
Here it is, pencil line. East of Swona.

355
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,213
If we got submarines to rendez-vous...

356
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:49,014
- In Sandwick Bay.
- In Sandwick Bay,

357
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:52,704
- We could bag the lot,
- Exactly.

358
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:57,627
They may alter the course, but I'll find out.

359
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:00,706
- From whom?
- My brother. He is flag captain.

360
00:35:00,954 --> 00:35:04,632
- He too...? 
- No. It's a case of brotherly trust.

361
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,235
When will this movement take place?

362
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:14,354
Tomorrow. Next day. Anytime. 
But you'll get plenty of notice.

363
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:17,997
We can't take submarines off blockade duty on suppositions.

364
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:21,127
Supposition nothing! Those squadrons are going to sail.

365
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:23,083
- The date? 
- I'll get it.

366
00:35:24,732 --> 00:35:26,849
It would be the biggest smash of the war.

367
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:30,693
Then, we understand each other?

368
00:35:31,457 --> 00:35:33,449
I hope so.

369
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,018
- To our next meeting.
- To our next meeting.

370
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:46,780
Mind you, behave yourself.

371
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:52,147
- Mr Ashington, what is your ship?
- The old Warspite.

372
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:54,430
She won't be going out with the squad?

373
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:58,435
- She's laid out for repairs, as usual.
- Pity.

374
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:05,917
You see, children. When look at this
little island of ours, you realize it is...

375
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:10,921
... the protector of much larger countries and continents.

376
00:36:11,526 --> 00:36:14,406
I know you don't like it but this isn't for a German audience.

377
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:18,240
- You've almost persuade me to become British.
- What would I say next?

378
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,765
There's the bit about the empire where the sun never sets.

379
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,375
But it needs explain.

380
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:30,616
Which way it goes? West-East or East-West?

381
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:33,777
It worries me. I bet children will know.

382
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:41,224
I shouldn't worry. You can teach them more important things.

383
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:44,862
How to get to an island guarded like Gibraltar.

384
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:50,464
How to twist British and German
officers round your little finger.

385
00:36:51,636 --> 00:36:55,028
Lots of things never taught in school.

386
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:57,919
Doesn't all that belong to evening school for grown-ups?

387
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:02,280
It is evening, and I am a grown-up.

388
00:37:02,564 --> 00:37:04,362
But you're not one of my pupils.

389
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:13,124
Tell me: what became of the real Miss Burnett?

390
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:17,654
- You know "Red Riding Hood"?
- It had a happy ending...

391
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,446
That's why this story is different.

392
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:30,096
- She met with an accident?
- Yes, an accident.

393
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:34,385
- Were you present?
- I obey orders in my service.

394
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:36,747
What a service!

395
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,621
Have you ever fire a torpedo on an unarmed ship?

396
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,671
- That's different!
- It's certainly more of the same.

397
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:57,632
Why do you look down on me?
I obey orders, as you obey yours.

398
00:37:57,804 --> 00:38:00,036
We don't choose the jobs we do.

399
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:04,568
We are parts of a machine of destruction. Like it or not.

400
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,972
Where is the key?

401
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:13,494
Here.

402
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:17,930
Good night.

403
00:39:32,794 --> 00:39:35,071
Thank you, children. That's very nice.
Now you may dismiss.

404
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:48,919
- Thank you very much. Good day.
- Good day.

405
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:19,345
- Any news? 
- I got it. They sail tomorrow.

406
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:20,863
- What time? 
- 7:00 a.m.

407
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,703
- No changes?
- No changes.

408
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:25,671
- You get in touch with your ship tonight.
- Be ready to leave at ten o'clock.

409
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:28,030
- Tonight?
- Of course. Good work.

410
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:32,032
- What is all this?
- Fraulein Thiel leaves with me.

411
00:40:38,723 --> 00:40:42,195
- This is the Reverend Hector Mathews.
- Is it? I mean, how'd you do?

412
00:40:42,366 --> 00:40:46,281
I'm sorry I can't shake hands. My name's
John Harris. I'm looking for the school.

413
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,964
- To what purpose, may I ask?
- See my fiancee, Ms. Burnett.

414
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:52,045
Ms Burnett didn't tell me she had any
connection with an English character.

415
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:54,409
No; but she soon will have.

416
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:58,173
If you are going to stay on the island
you may have a room at my house.

417
00:40:58,337 --> 00:41:02,049
- Far cheaper than lodging at the post office.
- Would it? I mean, that's very kind.

418
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,454
- May bring your fiancee to dinner tonight.
- Well...

419
00:41:05,623 --> 00:41:09,334
If you give me your meat coupons, we will make a roast.

420
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:13,057
- They're in my inside pocket and I rather...
- Allow me.

421
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:18,184
At 7:30 sharp.

422
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:23,629
- You wanted her to remain... 
-  Who cares what I want? Don't you see...

423
00:41:23,796 --> 00:41:26,631
- I only see one thing: my orders.
- Where are they?

424
00:41:27,038 --> 00:41:28,632
- Here.
- What do you mean here?

425
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,678
What were the actual orders?

426
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:33,311
On completion of the mission you'll be taken on board.

427
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:35,675
- On completion?
- Yes, on completion.

428
00:41:35,845 --> 00:41:38,122
And, is it completed?

429
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:43,081
Until your submarines come up with
our squadrons the job hasn't even began.

430
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:52,765
- I think he's right.
- No other way of looking at it.

431
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,822
I shall leave with a message. And tell Schuster
to depart tomorrow night for both of us.

432
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:02,820
Now you're talking sense.

433
00:42:03,385 --> 00:42:05,264
- Who's that?
- Turn off the light.

434
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,788
I'm awfully sorry. There must be another room.

435
00:42:14,393 --> 00:42:15,429
Come on in.

436
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:18,389
Thank you. Not expect to see officers staying here.

437
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,386
- It is difficult to find accomodation.
- Right.

438
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,995
- We were just gonna have tea.
- Join us.

439
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,553
Oh no really; I came to find my fiancee, Miss Burnett.

440
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:29,316
- Is she here?
- Milk and sugar?

441
00:42:29,484 --> 00:42:31,477
- Very kind.
- Let me take it.

442
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:34,003
More than kind of you. It's rather heavy.

443
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:38,083
- How'd you do?
- Sit down.

444
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:39,561
Thank you.

445
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:44,131
Wasn't strange of me not letting
her know that I'd arrive?

446
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,606
- Your tea.
- Thank you.

447
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,332
Well, I should give her a shout.

448
00:42:52,501 --> 00:42:56,179
I'm averse to shouting. All of us here.

449
00:42:58,426 --> 00:42:59,940
Well, in that case...

450
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:05,110
She'll be surprised to find me here, won't she?

451
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:07,467
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

452
00:43:08,993 --> 00:43:13,434
I brought this gramophone, and heaps of new records.

453
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:19,120
Have you heard "The Soldier's March"?

454
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:24,040
It's rather large, but it has a beautiful tune.

455
00:43:42,058 --> 00:43:45,257
I don't recognize that metal ribbon.

456
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,621
- What is it?
- The Iron Cross, second class.

457
00:43:50,384 --> 00:43:54,062
Second class... Then you must be a prisoner of war.

458
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:57,423
No. You are.

459
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,265
Oh dear!

460
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:06,348
Oh, they haven't arrived yet!

461
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:10,307
During a war, lateness for a meal is not only incivility but criminal waste.

462
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:12,995
- I'm scare the meat will burn. 
- I bring it nonetheless.

463
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:15,357
I will not wait longer.

464
00:44:17,644 --> 00:44:20,638
I'm greatly disappointed on Rev. Harris.

465
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:24,720
For what we are to receive may the
Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

466
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:35,093
- Don't bite these, are macaroni.
- I should have some expla...

467
00:44:45,464 --> 00:44:48,105
- Better wait here for them to come.
- Why?

468
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:50,702
- 'Stay here!
- Hurry.

469
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:21,926
- Who is it?
- Rev. Matthews and his wife.

470
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:37,294
Excuse me.

471
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:42,897
- Good evening my dear.
- You chose a high night to play calls.

472
00:45:43,067 --> 00:45:46,459
Obligations to society take precedence over nature.

473
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:50,591
- That's rather a compliment.
- A compliment was not my intention. We waited an hour.

474
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,944
- Outside?
- At table.

475
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:54,514
- At table?
- Precisely.

476
00:45:54,675 --> 00:45:58,512
- He's upset about the meat.
- Our concern has nothing to do with material.

477
00:45:58,678 --> 00:46:03,198
If you and Rev. could not come, courtesy demands a message.

478
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:06,959
- Then were you expecting us?
- You must have received our invitation.

479
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:11,006
- I'm afraid not. I had no idea.
- I find hard to believe he failed to convey it.

480
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,727
- I'm afraid he did.
- That's odd.

481
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:16,406
If I were your fiance, to see you after so long,

482
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:19,725
- ... I would forget everything else.
- Perhaps you would explain...

483
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:22,933
- The minute he arrived, he had a nasty attack.
- Attack?

484
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:25,692
Yes, sort of a suffocation. He wasn't able to say anything.

485
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:28,215
Oh, he is ill? I'm greatly relieved.

486
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:32,458
I put a room at his disposal. I
couldn't understand his not coming.

487
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,014
He's gone to bed an hour ago.

488
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:37,701
- It is the most sensible.
- An embarrassing situation.

489
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:41,539
Ms. Matthews should stay tonight.

490
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,704
- Shall I?
- There's no need for that.

491
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:48,026
As a Minister, I say that your position ...

492
00:46:48,195 --> 00:46:50,836
- As a future wife? 
- People might talk.

493
00:46:50,997 --> 00:46:53,911
In wartime? Do not worry about me.

494
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,200
My conscience calls me talk to Rvd. Harris.

495
00:46:58,602 --> 00:47:02,757
I will not disturb him to satisfy anybody's conscience.

496
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:04,246
Good night.

497
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:08,038
Then...  You choose to defy me?

498
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,765
Not at all. But this is my house I please myself.

499
00:47:11,012 --> 00:47:14,484
We'll see what the Education Committee thinks of it.

500
00:47:14,654 --> 00:47:16,213
- Good night. 
- Good night.

501
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:20,291
I understand, but he'll be fighting his conscience all night.

502
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:23,697
- Good night. 
- Good night.

503
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:38,461
Sandwick Bay? What a hole!

504
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:40,584
- Should take 2 hs to rendez vous.
- I hope so.

505
00:47:41,874 --> 00:47:45,074
We are 15 submarines. Our orders
are not to waste a single torpedo.

506
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,878
- Good.
- We could sink a few.

507
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:50,235
Tomorrow at same time come and pick us up.

508
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:53,395
Yes, sir. Bad luck missing a fight like this

509
00:47:53,563 --> 00:47:56,318
- for a woman.
- Mind your own business.

510
00:48:06,532 --> 00:48:08,650
- Good luck!
- Thank you, sir.

511
00:48:14,899 --> 00:48:16,538
- Schuster!
- Sir?

512
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,134
I nearly forgot.

513
00:48:19,622 --> 00:48:21,579
- What is it?
- Butter.

514
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,268
- Sorry...
- Come on.

515
00:49:05,896 --> 00:49:07,968
- What happened? Did the message go? 
- On its way.

516
00:49:08,138 --> 00:49:10,529
Never been so cold. Must be out of shape.

517
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,090
Damn fellow left me sitting in the hail.

518
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:16,222
Is not our costume to entertain enemy officers

519
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:18,615
however useful they may have been.

520
00:49:18,786 --> 00:49:22,542
- How does it feel to make history?
- I'll make some coffee to keep us warm.

521
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:26,750
Don't you keep him up; it's been a 
strenous evening, time he went to bed.

522
00:49:28,513 --> 00:49:32,475
Still you have some way to go,
suppose you set us an example?

523
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:35,716
Come on, have a bit of tact: can't
you see we want to be together?

524
00:49:35,878 --> 00:49:40,033
It's only two hours to dawn. Somebody
may wonder what has become of you.

525
00:49:40,722 --> 00:49:43,318
- I think I'll have another drink.
- Yes, do.

526
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:49,083
After all you'll have the whole
day tomorrow to bid you adieu.

527
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:54,931
Good night.

528
00:49:56,894 --> 00:50:01,175
- Persuasive fellow, aren't you?
- Sleep well.

529
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:10,415
That's better.

530
00:50:10,584 --> 00:50:13,384
- You didn't give him much choice.
- Oh, he's quite happy.

531
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:16,620
He has his whiskey and he is swinging down
the lane, convinced you're in love with him.

532
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:18,741
In a minute I'll be swinging up to bed.

533
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,426
No, no. I want to talk to you. And want that coffee.

534
00:50:21,912 --> 00:50:24,269
It's 4:00. Let's talk tomorrow.

535
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:27,752
Tomorrow? Can't you see this chance will never come again?

536
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,636
Our job is done.

537
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:33,760
In one hour the submarines will be
meeting and in two they should strike.

538
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,762
And in a week, you and I will be in Kiel,

539
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:39,161
How we'll celebrate!

540
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:42,923
Then on to Berlin. I can see us lunching at the Hotel Adlon.

541
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:47,609
You'll have the Iron Cross in your bag
and you'll be the only girl in Berlin...

542
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:50,604
in silk stockings.

543
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:54,728
Silk stockings I might take to bed.

544
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:59,894
I have served under many commanders
but none I admired more than you.

545
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,340
- What will you do when you're home again?
- You just told me.

546
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:06,975
- Trip to Berlin, the Adlon Hotel. 
- And after Berlin?

547
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:10,141
Another job. Another island. Another Ashington.

548
00:51:10,308 --> 00:51:12,618
And another captain Hardt?

549
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:14,947
Perhaps. Please let me go.

550
00:51:17,153 --> 00:51:21,069
Commander Thiel, don't forget that you won a victory.

551
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:24,715
A good commander must celebrate with his men.

552
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:27,713
If I'm in command, I order you to let me go.

553
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,820
David.

554
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:56,668
Jill.

555
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:04,153
- These have been the worst 10 minutes I ever spent.
- Me too.

556
00:54:04,436 --> 00:54:07,874
- It's all over now.
- Yes, darling.

557
00:54:13,202 --> 00:54:16,037
Little fool, what you mean coming out here without a coat?

558
00:54:16,605 --> 00:54:18,562
Running risks like that?

559
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,647
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, locked in his room.

560
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:23,880
You are a marvel.

561
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,010
Sir!

562
00:54:31,376 --> 00:54:32,810
Special Constable Bob Pratt, sir.

563
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:35,128
- Know who I am?
- You're Commander Blacklock, sir.

564
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,334
When the patrol arrives tell them
to stand by. Nobody goes in or out.

565
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:42,132
- Where is your armlet?
- When I heard German spies are about 

566
00:54:42,134 --> 00:54:44,784
I put it in my pocket, to be close and not recognized.

567
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:47,586
- Keep your eyes skinned.
- Aye, Aye, sir.

568
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,494
David, you won't have him arrested
until I leave the house, will you?

569
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,263
Give us credit for a little imagination.
Besides, he's safe enough in here.

570
00:55:02,278 --> 00:55:04,874
Couldn't you let him go back to his ship
and at least give him a fighting chance?

571
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,002
Too risky. He might find someone who
knew the real Thiel and Ashington.

572
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:12,723
- You hear that?
- What is it?

573
00:55:12,886 --> 00:55:14,559
The destroyer's flotilla.

574
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,689
They've been loading extra depth charges all
night. The result of our midnight labours.

575
00:55:20,372 --> 00:55:23,411
In a few hours, there won't be
any U-boats in Sandwick Bay,

576
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:28,046
just a few spots of grease,
drifting out to the North Sea.

577
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:40,820
- I think I'm rather sick.
- Here.

578
00:55:41,707 --> 00:55:43,381
Give it a pull a bit.

579
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:50,786
Woman: you're going into history!

580
00:55:55,117 --> 00:55:56,950
I know.

581
00:55:57,879 --> 00:56:02,160
Buzz upstairs and get your things.
I'm taking you straight to the St. Magnus,

582
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:04,315
she sails in an hour.

583
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:09,526
I haven't got anything of my own.
Everything is Anne Burnett's.

584
00:56:09,808 --> 00:56:11,766
Then, here we go.

585
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:27,254
- I'll be back in half an hour to get him. Stand by.
- Aye, aye, sir.

586
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:30,103
Sir; you wouldn't like us to save you the trouble?

587
00:56:30,263 --> 00:56:33,257
No. I have personal reasons
for doing this job myself.

588
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,329
You'll look after her?

589
00:56:40,491 --> 00:56:43,963
I'll be on the bridge. So my
cabin is for the lady to use.

590
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,524
- Very kind of yours. 
- It's a wee bit little, but it's warm,

591
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:50,054
- and you can have it all for yourself.
- Thank you.

592
00:56:55,302 --> 00:56:57,055
Well ...

593
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,523
Walter, hear, Walter. I warn you:

594
00:57:04,529 --> 00:57:08,999
Unless I got a day in port to work
on the bottom, it won't last one week.

595
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:12,331
- We'll see about it, James.
- I hope so.

596
00:57:12,394 --> 00:57:13,748
Excuse me.

597
00:57:16,237 --> 00:57:18,469
The Pastor! I left him tied up in school.

598
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,872
- Poor Mr Harris.
- To the rescue! Good bye.

599
00:57:22,802 --> 00:57:26,957
- You will take care, won't you?
- Indeed.

600
00:57:30,568 --> 00:57:34,040
- All present and correct.
- Thanks.

601
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:36,890
- Two around the back.
- You two,

602
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:40,870
... keep an eye on the window, but keep
out of sight. I don't want any casualties.

603
00:57:40,895 --> 00:57:44,095
Two on the road. The rest, you got the front of the house.

604
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,581
Keep close to the wall. The rest follow me.

605
00:57:50,743 --> 00:57:52,063
- You think he's gonna shoot us?
- Would you?

606
00:57:52,624 --> 00:57:55,698
You'll find a pastor in school. 
Cut him loose and calm him till I come.

607
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,982
He'll be rather annoyed. Stay here.

608
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:18,272
Captain Hardt, this is Commander
Blacklock, of the Royal Navy.

609
00:58:23,647 --> 00:58:27,484
If you throw your gun out the window
and surrender, you'll be treated as a POW.

610
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,004
Otherwise, you'll be shot.

611
00:58:29,491 --> 00:58:31,643
- Nobody at school, sir.
- What?

612
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:44,091
Untie the poor devil!

614
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,508
Cast off!

615
00:58:55,951 --> 00:58:59,070
- Hold on. A passenger's coming.
- Aye, sir.

616
00:59:03,116 --> 00:59:06,235
Mr. Harris, commander Blacklock asked
for you. I'll tell him that you caught the boat.

617
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:18,085
I asked myself: if all is as it should be,

618
00:59:18,607 --> 00:59:21,123
Why I am prevented from seeing Rev. Harris?

619
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:25,969
I can tell you: Harris was tied in school
because he was a nuisance.

620
00:59:26,573 --> 00:59:28,770
You were lucky not to suffer the same fate.

621
00:59:28,935 --> 00:59:33,375
- Under Blacklock you would have.
- I cannot pretend to understand.

622
00:59:33,538 --> 00:59:37,534
I'll help you. And attempt was made
by German spies to kill Anne Burnett

623
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:40,501
and put an agent in her place.
Fortunately, it failed.

624
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:45,335
They drop her off a cliff, but by a 100
to 1 chance a patrol boat fished her out.

625
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:49,779
She said enough so we grabbed the spy in Thurso.

626
00:59:50,551 --> 00:59:53,306
Then we had the idea of replacing
her with a counter-spy.

627
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:57,831
In short notice we found a brave volunteer,

628
00:59:58,276 --> 01:00:00,712
the girl you know as Anne Burnett.

629
01:00:00,878 --> 01:00:05,113
The Anne Burnett at school is not the teacher,

630
01:00:05,362 --> 01:00:08,595
Nor the Anne Burnett the Germans intended.

631
01:00:08,764 --> 01:00:11,838
- She's not Miss Burnett at all.
- Substantially correct.

632
01:00:12,087 --> 01:00:16,606
- Then who is she?
- That's an official secret.

633
01:00:22,254 --> 01:00:25,054
- What's the matter, Blacklock?
- Hardt, sir, he got away.

634
01:00:25,216 --> 01:00:27,857
- The German?
- Locked Harris, and he wears his clothes.

635
01:00:28,018 --> 01:00:29,168
Excuse me, sir.

636
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,534
Signals? Send a call to all patrols in the island.

637
01:00:33,903 --> 01:00:35,815
He won't get away, sir. He can't do any harm.

638
01:01:05,486 --> 01:01:06,886
All aboard for mainland!

639
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,375
Stop!

640
01:01:18,536 --> 01:01:20,607
All, in single file.

641
01:01:21,017 --> 01:01:23,135
One by one. Look.

642
01:01:35,628 --> 01:01:37,062
Put them aboard there.

643
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,948
Here we are, sir. All present.

644
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,527
- Eight German prisoners.
- Look starved to me.

645
01:01:43,554 --> 01:01:45,068
Are they off a U-boat?

646
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:48,469
It blew. On one of their own mines.

647
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,197
One of their...?

648
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,473
- You think they'll see the joke?
- Guess not.

649
01:01:59,726 --> 01:02:02,037
Here, by the right!

650
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,282
You're the right man!

651
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:06,123
I do not understand.

652
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:09,444
It's like talking to stuffed dummies.

653
01:02:09,613 --> 01:02:13,655
Well, stand easy; you're depressing.

654
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:19,213
- What do I do with them?
- Split them up. Forr'ard and aft.

655
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:21,579
Steward!

656
01:02:23,904 --> 01:02:26,784
- Aye, aye, sir. 
- Give them some coffee.

657
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:28,896
Poor devils.

658
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:37,228
- Walter!
- Well, James?

659
01:02:37,394 --> 01:02:40,945
I am not superstitious, but I do not like this.

660
01:02:41,116 --> 01:02:43,074
Mind the engines and I'll mind the ship.

661
01:02:43,238 --> 01:02:46,232
No mind my mentioning.

662
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,600
Six weeks I've been trying to fix
a new lining to the bottom of this.

663
01:02:50,243 --> 01:02:54,922
I do not like those Germans. Bad luck.

664
01:02:55,407 --> 01:02:58,048
They could go in the St. Ninian with the other prisoners.

665
01:02:58,209 --> 01:03:01,203
They were crowded. They will not give us problems.

666
01:03:01,972 --> 01:03:04,727
4 in the forecastle and 4 in the saloon,

667
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:09,334
a sentry for four. No one can reach them.

668
01:03:09,697 --> 01:03:13,613
Well... Maybe.

669
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:40,679
Too young.

670
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:51,321
- Father, they only speak German.
- Shut up or die.

671
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:55,282
Captain Hardt. Taking command of the ship.

672
01:03:55,451 --> 01:03:57,808
Take care of the crew. Come on!

673
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:17,865
Your replacement, he's overdue.

674
01:04:25,993 --> 01:04:29,227
No sausages. It's what you eat, right?

675
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,319
- The Germans!
- Stop!

676
01:04:53,534 --> 01:04:55,730
Below there!

677
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:58,734
Doddie!

678
01:05:07,424 --> 01:05:08,699
Doddie!

679
01:05:09,065 --> 01:05:10,738
Give me the rocket launcher.

680
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:17,101
- Get off my bridge whoever you are!
- Drop that pistol.

681
01:05:17,431 --> 01:05:21,427
- You're my prisoner.
- Get out of here or I'll shoot!

682
01:05:21,594 --> 01:05:23,473
Do not move.

683
01:05:23,996 --> 01:05:26,796
- Your ship is in my hands.
- And who might you be?

684
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:29,428
- I'm a German officer.
- On those clothes?

685
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,560
They do for the present. Where is your wireless kept?

686
01:05:32,723 --> 01:05:35,603
- There is none.
- No wireless?

687
01:05:35,925 --> 01:05:38,441
No German went out of the house
while I was at duty, Admiral.

688
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:40,958
I handed over to the patrol; there
were nine of them and one of me.

689
01:05:41,129 --> 01:05:44,168
You didn't suspect that passenger on the pier?
Where were your eyes, man?

690
01:05:44,331 --> 01:05:48,088
He jumped aboard when she was casting off.
I did deliver your message, commander.

691
01:05:48,254 --> 01:05:50,929
- Yes, you told us that before.
- That will do, Bob.

692
01:05:51,096 --> 01:05:55,297
- You got to give credit to Hardt ...
- I give to him for causing this infernal cheek!

693
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:57,133
He can't get away, sir.

694
01:05:57,981 --> 01:06:00,292
Signals: Wire Scrabster and Thurso.

695
01:06:00,463 --> 01:06:03,377
"Arrest German officer masquerading as a passenger. Stop".

696
01:06:03,545 --> 01:06:05,697
To all the patrols.

697
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:09,145
"Order St. Magnus to heave to and
await destroyer." Repeat that back.

698
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:17,353
Go below! Go!
Attention.

699
01:06:20,718 --> 01:06:22,870
- I need two men. 
- Very well.

700
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,997
Keep an eye on the crew and passengers.

701
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:28,474
To monitor crew and passengers! Come with me.

702
01:06:31,246 --> 01:06:34,240
Stay calm. Let's take a look.

703
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:39,920
Out.

704
01:06:43,094 --> 01:06:45,815
- How did you escape?
- That I must thank you for.

705
01:06:45,977 --> 01:06:49,210
Sentiment made you stop being Fraulein Thiel 

706
01:06:49,379 --> 01:06:52,020
- Or Miss Burnett...
- Mrs. Blacklock!

707
01:06:53,062 --> 01:06:56,853
That's one secret you kept well. How considerate.

708
01:06:57,145 --> 01:06:58,579
Now you captured the ship what will you do?

709
01:06:58,786 --> 01:07:01,302
Lay a course for the submarines at Sandwick.

710
01:07:01,468 --> 01:07:03,745
- You can't do that!
- I'm not under your orders!

711
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:06,999
- But it is full of mines!
- We shall both take our chance.

712
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,214
- This doesn't mean you and me.
- Right: It means the life of hundreds of my comrades!

713
01:07:11,215 --> 01:07:15,199
- But the children and women here aren't people?
- That will be at your door, not mine.

714
01:07:15,238 --> 01:07:17,999
The war broke. You forget, as I did before.

715
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,681
- You are English, I'm German. We are enemies!
- I like that better.

716
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:23,444
And I. It simplifies everything!

717
01:07:24,205 --> 01:07:25,685
Come on.

718
01:07:32,731 --> 01:07:35,088
- Lay a course, East.
- East, captain.

719
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:43,938
Now what, sir?

720
01:07:57,189 --> 01:08:00,308
Listen. You're held as prisoners of war.

721
01:08:00,832 --> 01:08:03,142
I do not want any noise and panic.

722
01:08:04,034 --> 01:08:06,504
Whoever disobeys orders will be shot.

723
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:08,990
With one exception.

724
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:19,562
- Be quiet!
- Easy.

725
01:08:19,806 --> 01:08:24,405
A19, A24, A7... St. Magnus spotted
by 3 patrols. Still on the right course.

726
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:27,205
There are eight German prisoners on that ship.

727
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:31,532
- What are you doing, you can go home.
- Thank you.

728
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:35,926
If they join forces with a desperate man like Hardt...

729
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:40,499
- Message from A17.
- No sighting. She's overdue.

730
01:08:42,302 --> 01:08:45,102
She set a different course between A7 and A17.

731
01:08:47,546 --> 01:08:49,583
Sandwick Bay.

732
01:08:50,988 --> 01:08:53,299
My wife is on that ship.

733
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,825
- Orderly.
- Yes, sir.

734
01:08:54,991 --> 01:08:57,712
I want to see the commander of the flotilla.

735
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:05,113
I'm sorry. You'll have to forget personal affairs.

736
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:07,713
Sir?

737
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,217
We believe St. Magnus was captured by German
prisoners who are making a rush for Sandwick.

738
01:09:13,244 --> 01:09:15,919
Cmdr Blacklock will advise you on the course to be taken.

739
01:09:16,207 --> 01:09:18,962
Go out to Switha Sound and cut her off.

740
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:22,244
- She's to be sunk?
- If they won't surrender...

741
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,260
Skipper!

742
01:09:37,903 --> 01:09:39,656
Skipper!

743
01:09:45,508 --> 01:09:47,227
- Are you there, Walter? 
- Huh?

744
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:52,428
We can't keep at this speed much longer.

745
01:09:53,274 --> 01:09:55,870
It's murdering my bearings.

746
01:09:56,837 --> 01:10:00,468
Fearful pressure on engines. 
I don't know how the ship'll put up with.

747
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,760
- Where are we going?
- Due east.

748
01:10:04,722 --> 01:10:07,397
Soon we will leave the patrolled area.

749
01:10:07,564 --> 01:10:10,205
- We're in the hands of the providence.
- No we are not; we are in the hands

750
01:10:10,366 --> 01:10:12,882
of a man who cares nothing for his life or yours.

751
01:10:13,048 --> 01:10:16,680
It's all my fault, cause I forgot that we were at war,

752
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:20,210
that the war kills any decent human feeling.

753
01:10:37,707 --> 01:10:40,382
- Can you shake it up a bit?
- No, it's flat out now.

754
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:02,964
The old man is deaf or dumb. 
Or is a U-boat he's after.

755
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:12,131
Out.

756
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:15,007
Out!

757
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:23,330
Funny; there's no sign of the old tub yet.

758
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,811
- Perhaps they altered course again.
- Not likely.

759
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:44,908
Have a look, Felix. 
Is not the St. Magnus?

760
01:11:48,118 --> 01:11:51,431
It's her all right. What's she doing so off course?

761
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:53,675
- Looks suspicious.
- What a cinch!

762
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:56,719
We gotta save all the torpedoes!

763
01:11:57,726 --> 01:12:00,606
Nothing in the orders to stop
us sending a couple of shells...

764
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:04,442
Stand by to surface!

765
01:12:04,931 --> 01:12:07,367
Guns trough, action stations.
Objective: steamship. Steer right.

766
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:30,060
Remove the British flag.

767
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:46,470
The U29!

768
01:12:49,404 --> 01:12:52,318
Schuster! Schuster!

769
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:58,965
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

770
01:13:01,412 --> 01:13:04,851
It's me, Hardt!

771
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:19,662
There's someone semaphoring from the bridge!

772
01:13:19,986 --> 01:13:21,818
H - A - R

774
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,157
There's firing down the haven.

775
01:13:42,443 --> 01:13:45,482
Better take a look. Hold the course, Number One.

776
01:13:57,534 --> 01:14:00,653
Wear the lifevests. Get to the lifeboats.

777
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,732
Stay calm.

778
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:07,258
To the lifeboat!

779
01:14:22,472 --> 01:14:25,511
Keep calm and put on the floats.

780
01:14:27,356 --> 01:14:31,192
Donald, stop what you're doing
and come up to the deck. Hurry up.

781
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,329
There she is!

782
01:14:50,293 --> 01:14:51,612
Stand by. Guns out.

783
01:14:55,176 --> 01:14:59,411
- Don't fire!. She's sinking by the stern.
- They're taking to the boats, sir.

784
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,614
Captain, look, destroyer!

785
01:15:04,663 --> 01:15:06,097
Crash dive!

786
01:15:06,344 --> 01:15:09,344
She's being shelled by a U-boat.

01:15:09,344 --> 01:15:12,101
We'll have a crack at it, Number One!

787
01:15:16,572 --> 01:15:17,767
Objective: submarine.

788
01:15:21,936 --> 01:15:23,768
Depth charge... ready!

790
01:16:23,821 --> 01:16:26,337
- You may leave.
- Not without you.

791
01:16:26,823 --> 01:16:29,737
That's an order!

792
01:16:31,106 --> 01:16:34,021
It's time to go, miss. Take it to the boat, James.

793
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:43,667
It's my old ship that sank us.

794
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:53,911
Come on now Missi, come on. Hurry.

795
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:00,560
What are you doing here? 
You should get into a boat.

796
01:17:00,808 --> 01:17:03,688
If you don't mind, I'd rather stay.

797
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:05,962
Suit yourself. It's your business.

798
01:17:07,854 --> 01:17:10,768
Captain, have you got a cigarette?

799
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:13,568
Never smoke them, but got
a pipe if you want it.

800
01:17:13,738 --> 01:17:17,210
- Never smoke a pipe.
- A little late to learn.

801
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:55,923
She's there. I can see her!
