1
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,169
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY.

2
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,687
THE MASTER OF LIFE.

3
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,877
I remember how it was.

4
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,379
I was lost.

5
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,799
Maybe not lost,
but surely drifting.

6
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,344
I think those guys from the movies...

7
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,388
Starving on a raft provisional...

8
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,099
Suffering with the waves
and looking for land...

9
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,310
Living hope.

10
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,147
Deep down,
I had this crazy idea...

11
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,734
That he was destined for something big.

12
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,819
Not that I wanted to be noticed...

13
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:37,908
It was like I was destined
to leave my mark on the world.

14
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,288
I remember well what
happened that summer.

15
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:47,000
There was a wave of excitement around me
.

16
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,088
I was connected to something
that guided me since my birth...

17
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,342
Here and now,
when I create...

18
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,886
's When I feel more confident.

19
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,847
Is when I feel I do the right thing...

20
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,765
A wave of emotions hit me...

21
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,310
Most of them is the best I've ever met.

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,316
But there is always an idiot
to judge us by what we do.

23
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,694
What the hell.

24
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,363
The worst criticisms
usually come from people...

25
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,574
Who have no idea of?? what we do...

26
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,325
Not have special gifts...

27
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,744
And get angry when we are happy...

28
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,163
Cheerfully and provoke us.

29
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,459
Unless, of course, we are leaving the uglier.

30
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,337
So that kind of person
will hold our hand with pleasure...

31
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:36,800
And dance with us in the gutter
saying, as they...

32
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:41,638
See how horrible it is
and they love to celebrate.

33
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,643
But learned early...

34
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,189
That any idiot can see how things are ugly.

35
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,524
No need to gift for it.

36
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,237
So, this is a story adult.

37
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,618
If you decide to be cynical,
is an unfortunate choice.

38
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,661
Cynics usually are right.

39
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,581
The Romantics are usually wrong.

40
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,375
But a romantic
only need to be right once in a lifetime...

41
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,045
When choosing his true love.

42
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,466
I think this story really about love.

43
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,011
Maybe it was better if I just say that.

44
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,265
But then
Nicholi would not know how I knew.

45
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,644
And it would be unfair to both of us.

46
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,788
PORT CHESTER, NEW YORK...

47
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,589
Have you seen my son?
- No, Mr. Talia.

48
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,342
Should be painted.

49
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,220
What said, Mikey?

50
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,389
Nothing, sir.

51
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,571
John.

52
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,739
John.

53
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,242
John.

54
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,535
My goodness.

55
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,704
What are you doing?

56
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,588
John...

57
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,842
You like girls?

58
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,095
My father was a complete homophobe.

59
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,056
He catch me using brushes
was almost the same as I get...

60
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,976
Oral sex with one of my friends.

61
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,772
Why do I ask these questions?

62
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,484
Is full of paintings of men with things out.

63
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,111
This is hard to do, you know?

64
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,530
Draw the contours and make the shadows.

65
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,659
Do not do it because I like men,
do it to be a good artist.

66
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:08,660
Only...

67
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,122
Do me a favor, take your friends Wall.

68
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,334
Mother?
- Yes, Johnny.

69
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,211
Can you tell me something?

70
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,629
What do you think of this?

71
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,088
Seriously.

72
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,299
My goodness.

73
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,676
It's beautiful, Johnny.

74
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,222
Very beautiful.
- Really?

75
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,183
You got ink on your hands?
- No.

76
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,726
Are you sure?
- I just wash.

77
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,977
Take.

78
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,813
I want you to wear this.
Drop it.

79
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,107
Take.
- Dressing?

80
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,692
Do you want me to wear this?

81
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,903
No, I just want to hold.

82
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,614
Here?
- Yes, for me to see.

83
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,577
My mother was born in Germany.

84
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,455
She was 16 years old,
when the Allies stormed Berlin.

85
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,040
I had another child to talk...

86
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,335
Because I was busy digging
traps since age 11.

87
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,755
She was also a woman
very complicated and troubled.

88
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,716
Though he knew she hated
what the Nazis did to our country...

89
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,596
Think she secretly hoped
by the Germans in the war movies.

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,349
Gonna be beautiful.

91
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,270
Knew who inherited his talent from me?

92
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,106
Thank you.

93
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,489
Good.

94
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,658
Very good, John.

95
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,081
Johnny?

96
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,750
Try not to use so much black.

97
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,295
Try to find...

98
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,046
Colors...

99
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,673
Streets.

100
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,802
And always try to find
the colors in the shadows.

101
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,679
Violet, blue, green.

102
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,141
In other words, do not use both black.

103
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,767
Thank you.

104
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,021
And always look for the design.
There is design in everything.

105
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,981
Come here.

106
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,066
You see the telephone poles?

107
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:06,820
None is righteous,
mostly in a good frame.

108
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,157
A is a little left.
Other, slightly to the right.

109
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,492
You see the shadows across the street?

110
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,204
See how
bind to the concrete of the building?

111
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,873
Yes
- Think in the abstract.

112
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,583
Okay.

113
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,793
I will frame this.

114
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,380
Yammi,
can not afford the gold leaf.

115
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,884
Who said I was going to charge?

116
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,177
No, no.

117
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,845
John, no favors.

118
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,597
No favors.
Pay it.

119
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,681
Okay.

120
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,892
Got it.

121
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,311
My goodness.

122
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,355
Is a Seroff.

123
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,524
I know, but...

124
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,108
How to get it?

125
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,653
I enquadrei for Joe Caresiro.

126
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,780
As a plumber may have a picture of these?

127
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,407
Not worth as much as before.

128
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,410
Why?

129
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,912
's Representative.

130
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,205
So what?

131
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,541
Is irrelevant.

132
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,708
By whom?

133
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,210
Critics.

134
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,419
Magazines art.

135
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,004
Fuck.
This is gorgeous.

136
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,215
John, look at the mouth.

137
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,716
How much?

138
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:10,801
I do not know.

139
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,928
Seroff exchanged it for plumber services.

140
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,972
Really?
He?? lives near here?

141
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,056
Yes, down the street.

142
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,851
Father, hear that?
- Yes, that's wonderful.

143
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,352
Do you know him?

144
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,438
I guess nobody really knows.

145
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,190
I saw him a few times.

146
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,359
Really?

147
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,487
If you are thinking of going there...

148
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,823
Visit that old bastard...

149
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,242
I would not advise.

150
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,451
Him..

151
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,536
Crazy?

152
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,997
No had no use for them.

153
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,582
I'm not people.

154
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,083
And I love talking about art.

155
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,004
So, Johnny?
Will bothering that old bastard?

156
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,048
Father, why do you always think
I bother people?

157
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,176
Why do you bother.
- I'm just excited.

158
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,053
This is Yammi...

159
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,181
Normal?

160
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,557
How so?

161
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,310
It is normal or is sensitive?

162
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,437
Sensitive.
- If he's in a good mood?

163
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,814
You know what I'm asking.
Do not pull a smartass.

164
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,566
Do not know what to say.

165
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,026
What is to be sensitive?
- Shut up.

166
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,485
I do not know.
- Stop.

167
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,654
I do not know.
- John.

168
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,526
Who is?

169
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,736
Mr. Seroff?

170
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,908
Whatever?

171
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,705
I'm so beautiful that must be staring at me?

172
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,959
Is a handyman?

173
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:53,297
Whether gardening,
mowing the lawn, prune the trees?

174
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,175
No, I...
- No, no, no, what?

175
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,180
Is Nicholi Seroff?

176
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,639
Damn.

177
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,808
Yes, I am.

178
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,853
his books.

179
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,897
Leu?

180
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,482
I think it's brilliant.

181
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,026
I am brilliant?

182
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,235
Yes.

183
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,446
The use of color...

184
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,657
What you said about composition...

185
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,826
That trees are like naked
people dancing on the slopes...

186
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,994
.

187
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,370
I say that?

188
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:29,875
Yes, also said that trees are like men.

189
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,960
Do not invade the space of another...

190
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,546
A lesson to be learned with nature.

191
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,382
No shortage, only abundance.

192
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,634
Yes, yes.

193
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,844
Damn.

194
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,056
It was nice talking to you.

195
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,774
Nicholi?

196
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,943
Is Yammi.

197
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,153
Yammi.

198
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,656
I'm fine, great.

199
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:05,285
I learned that a friend went
to visit him the other day.

200
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,703
Yes, boy.

201
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,247
His name is John.

202
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,749
And I think he is talented.

203
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,001
He would come over there...

204
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,046
And talk with you about painting.

205
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,215
Yes.

206
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,801
Okay.

207
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,387
Good night.

208
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,351
He is not interested.

209
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,937
Not...

210
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,897
What did he say?

211
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,317
That was no time.

212
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,444
He was not interested?

213
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,113
Listen...

214
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,156
John, I forget if I were you.

215
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,618
To my knowledge, he had many problems
...

216
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,496
And it was a pain in his better days...

217
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,874
So imagine how it is now.

218
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,840
This is...

219
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:00,966
Very good.

220
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,177
Very good indeed.

221
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,803
Thank you.

222
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,222
Say, why us?
Why here?

223
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,266
Mean...

224
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:13,395
Why not
Pratt or Parsons School of Design?

225
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,356
Father?

226
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,526
What?

227
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:24,156
Asked his son if he thought
about Pratt or Parsons.

228
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:29,786
Okay.

229
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,122
Okay, he will study here.

230
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:37,669
A Moment.

231
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:38,879
Mr. Seroff?

232
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,382
I would appreciate if you could talk to you.

233
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,593
Wait, wait.

234
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,307
The boy.

235
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,809
You again.
What do you want?

236
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:57,940
First, do not want to bother you.
It was not my intention. Sorry.

237
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:01,026
Good thing it was not his intention.

238
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,071
Just wanted to know...

239
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,156
If you give class.

240
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,449
No.

241
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,076
Do not I teach.

242
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,869
And do not paint.

243
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,373
You know I'm a friend of Yammi, right?

244
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,502
He ended up with you?

245
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,214
Now he wants you to be my problem?

246
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,424
Okay?

247
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,970
Do not trust anyone who does not drink.

248
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,305
How so?

249
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,143
If you do not drink, it means he
wants to continue in the shadows...

250
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,020
.

251
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,065
I think we understand, is not it?

252
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,736
Now that is intimate can make jokes?

253
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,572
Sorry.

254
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,908
Not looking his muse.

255
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,119
Means that will teach me?

256
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,287
No.

257
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,663
Go to college.

258
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,748
Not teach painting actually there.

259
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,542
Of course not.

260
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,962
May God not allow
teach something with form and substance.

261
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,214
Or something that makes
people feel something...

262
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,507
Feel...

263
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,217
Is the enemy leadership.

264
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,846
Not may be smarter than them or crucify.

265
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:15,142
In my opinion, the painting died
and never coming back.

266
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,604
The common man was unable to create.

267
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,065
Why?
The common man's common sense.

268
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,026
Do not accept crap.

269
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:28,447
And the common man sees junk
miles away.

270
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:32,701
Therefore, there is no place for it in
art today.

271
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,205
There is a conspiracy against art today.

272
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,168
Do not these idiots untalented
do not mind...

273
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,338
With the end of humanity. No.

274
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,798
But believe...

275
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,177
Still is a conspiracy.

276
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,681
A shared journey...

277
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,726
Is an experience more exciting...

278
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,229
What a journey made alone.

279
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,565
Humans...

280
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,026
Need validation.
That's how we learn.

281
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,278
We fear what we do not understand.

282
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,239
Writers pass by something.

283
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,407
We need help.

284
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:13,909
The Art...

285
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,577
Shared...

286
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,247
Is part of the validation of feeling.

287
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,415
When there is no context...

288
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,626
No statement.

289
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,920
When there is no statement, no exchange.

290
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,381
When there is no exchange, no beauty.

291
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:31,176
When there is beauty, there is no art.

292
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:35,556
If you see beauty
everywhere, in everything...

293
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,140
His soul is released.

294
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,309
No one can steal it.

295
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,812
I know that is true.

296
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,188
How do you know?

297
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,357
I just know.

298
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,609
Okay.

299
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,820
Believe in God?

300
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,113
I think so.

301
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,574
Does your prayers at night?
- Yes...

302
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,993
...believed what is heard?

303
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:57,786
Yes.

304
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,037
In my opinion...

305
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:03,000
Atheists never be great painters.

306
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,378
To create an art major...

307
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:09,756
Man must make peace with mortality...

308
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,218
And revere the greatest reverenciador.

309
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:18,473
The duty of the artist is
to elevate the human soul.

310
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,226
Ignorance leads us to this.

311
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,021
Men are crazy,
are bitches...

312
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,940
They should hang at the Guggenheim...

313
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,735
Frame with childish fears.

314
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,904
It would make more sense.

315
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,114
You have to teach me that.

316
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,782
You must teach me how to paint.

317
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,534
No.

318
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,453
God mad...

319
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,455
And you would be miserable.

320
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,957
Do not do it for the money.

321
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,543
Good to know.

322
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,380
And if I bring my screens...

323
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,132
You look at them and
tell me what you think?

324
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,300
Real quick?

325
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,469
No, I...

326
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,972
'm Going to Pennsylvania.

327
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,140
Pennsylvania?
- Yes...

328
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,267
Why?
- I have a house there.

329
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,560
paint?

330
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:07,105
No, I have a girlfriend.
A tall blonde with big breasts.

331
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,274
Really?
- No.

332
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,820
And if I bring some screens
before traveling?

333
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,032
'll Stop bothering me after?

334
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,742
Absolutely.

335
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,953
Absolutely.

336
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,330
Good.

337
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,748
Tomorrow.

338
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:28,335
Go before I change my mind.
- Thank you.

339
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,426
Did all this alone?

340
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,721
No help from anyone without class?

341
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,683
No class.

342
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,770
Good, because
hate to think that someone paid...

343
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:50,023
To paint pictures so horrible.

344
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,068
There has not talent...

345
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,486
But...

346
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,073
...seeing things through
the eyes of other men.

347
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,284
This one has good trees.

348
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:04,788
But I have seen these trees
in multiple frames.

349
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:11,420
Branch This is beautiful.
You stole Robert Wood.

350
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,464
Okay?

351
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,675
What is this?

352
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,846
Should be clouds or flying rocks?

353
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,975
Clouds are not so white.

354
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,186
Come, let us look.

355
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,316
These clouds look white to you?

356
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:38,864
Yes.

357
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,866
Fuck.

358
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,701
This is white.

359
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,286
See.

360
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,787
Is white.

361
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,582
Still look white to you?

362
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,964
My goodness.

363
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,176
That's it. Are hotter...

364
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,263
The summit is yellow, violet.
- Great.

365
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,058
Now take.

366
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,103
So...

367
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,522
Yes...

368
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,982
Get your things and go.

369
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,653
Wish IHE luck.
I wish IHE luck.

370
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,140
I thought we had an agreement.

371
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,893
Just wanted to thank you.

372
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,104
Thank you.

373
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,274
Joking. Come in.

374
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,736
Between.

375
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,614
Like that.

376
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:04,783
It makes me laugh.

377
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:07,619
My parents also like.

378
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,124
Mr. Seroff?

379
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,793
Stop calling me that, my name is Nicholi.

380
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:16,378
Okay.

381
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,589
Sorry. Nicholi?

382
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:24,094
Just want to know if I can see his studio.

383
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,762
Why?

384
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,931
I would like to see it.

385
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:30,893
The studio is not for boys.

386
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,521
Can I go alone, no problem.
Just show the direction.

387
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:35,731
What?

388
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,399
Can I go alone.
Do not need...

389
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:41,153
I do not want you going up there alone.

390
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,322
Damn.

391
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:46,074
Now I do not know what happened.

392
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,243
Sorry. Sorry.

393
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,496
Come on, you worthless.

394
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,706
Come.

395
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,461
My drink worthless.

396
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,401
Take a look.

397
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,615
Wow.

398
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,200
I could live here.

399
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,369
Yes, you and the rats.

400
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,377
What will you do on this screen?

401
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,420
Can take it,
I do not use for anything.

402
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,047
I can not take it.

403
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,216
One day...

404
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,635
Guess ten years ago...

405
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:48,887
A fool says...

406
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:52,724
Representational art that was sentimental...

407
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,351
Past.

408
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:58,897
I said to myself: 'I'll give him a lesson, idiot.'

409
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,358
I'd pick my paintings...

410
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,027
And burn that magazine.

411
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:08,991
You say something nice, especially...

412
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:12,369
But then...

413
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,956
I said...

414
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,835
'Fuck. Who cares?'.

415
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,004
You cares what the critics think?

416
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,840
Are you kidding me,
worthless?

417
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:28,677
No, you do not strike me as the kind of man
...

418
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,888
Who cares what people think.

419
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:34,183
This is all pretty much worthless...

420
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,809
But you're young.

421
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,770
And life will still be hard for you.

422
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:39,980
Really?

423
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,524
Why do you think I have an easy life?

424
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:44,693
Yet seen the worst.

425
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,070
What people are able...

426
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,448
Inflicting each other.

427
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:57,414
When I painted this, I always
thought the big men...

428
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,001
Who stood in front of a screen before me.

429
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:04,922
Da Vinci,
and his technique 'chiaroscuro'...

430
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,633
I'm sure that does not know what is.

431
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:09,843
Light and space.
The natural recession of an object...

432
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,553
When is affected by light.

433
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,263
Great. Great.

434
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:16,600
Monet, Manet, Pizarro.

435
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:17,935
Renoir.

436
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,395
They made me see colors...

437
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,273
Mostly secondary colors.

438
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,778
Certainly not know what I speak.
- I know.

439
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:28,946
Do you know?

440
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,697
Violet, green, orange.

441
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,866
Fechin know who that was?
- Yes...

442
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:36,036
Who was that?
- A Russian artist. Painted in towels.

443
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:39,081
Fechin was obsessed by the edges.

444
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,960
The two- objects in space.

445
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,462
Lines are human concepts.

446
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,381
There are no lines in nature.

447
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:49,174
I disagree.

448
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:53,971
John Carlson says in his book that all
edge must be hard.

449
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,514
Okay.

450
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,808
Okay. Alright.

451
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,394
Teach me something useless.

452
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,689
Van Gogh and Redfield
outlining everything.

453
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,899
True.

454
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:09,111
Making things less natural.

455
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,447
And, in my opinion,
more expressive.

456
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:16,285
Life is too short to do simple paintings.

457
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,954
I need to show I was here.

458
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:19,955
Fuck.

459
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,081
I've been here.

460
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,875
Here. This planet.

461
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,711
Here.
- Calm down, can hear it.

462
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:28,755
What is the first thing that looks?
- The local color.

463
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,965
What is it?

464
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,427
Is the essence of the object
before being affected by the fence.

465
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:34,887
Bravo.

466
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,055
Very Good.

467
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,933
Honestly, Nicholi,
I can recite it.

468
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,518
I've read, I already know.

469
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,811
But...

470
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:46,398
Know what it means?
I can apply to my work? No.

471
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,609
It is not surprising.

472
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,278
If I knew the answer,
would be meaningless.

473
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:55,616
But these things can only be achieved with
practice.

474
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:56,950
E...

475
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,869
This is very important...

476
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:01,914
You are allowed to make mistakes.

477
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,416
There is no secret.

478
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,460
Only work.

479
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:07,836
That.

480
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,755
That's right.

481
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:10,881
I want to work.

482
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:13,634
Can you talk about the progress
art and not help me...

483
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:16,386
As someone surely helped in the past.

484
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:17,638
Is that fair?

485
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,806
Okay. Alright.

486
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,433
Great.

487
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,187
You can go to Pennsylvania with me
summer.

488
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,481
Even if you have to kill him...

489
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,358
'll Teach him to paint.

490
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,568
If embrace me...

491
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,654
I kill him now.

492
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,864
Okay.

493
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:50,504
Are you saying you want to go
to the interior with an old man?

494
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:51,797
Yes...

495
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:54,466
...is a great opportunity for me.

496
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,718
How?
- He is a Russian master.

497
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,637
Great. It is Russian, no less.

498
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,139
Going back a communist
and who knows what else.

499
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,058
Father, you have to let me do this.

500
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,060
No, will not do that, forget it.

501
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:08,021
Will work with me in the summer.

502
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,694
Bullshit.

503
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,362
Caution.

504
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,281
You can not arrest me well.

505
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:19,491
Johnny, no.

506
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,827
Do not do this to your father.

507
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,413
Sorry, mom, but
knows he can not arrest me well.

508
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:27,666
You will not inward...
- Why not?

509
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,293
With an old.
- Why not?

510
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,086
How so 'why not'?

511
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,005
Do not be silly.
Do you know why.

512
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,673
Wake up.

513
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,092
You know what he wants.

514
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,556
There is something wrong with you.

515
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,984
I hope this better touch than paints.

516
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:58,405
I'm going there in search of tranquility,
not need noise.

517
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,907
Seeking quiet.

518
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,742
Okay.
- Put in there.

519
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,911
I play bass.

520
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,538
Tell...

521
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,875
Parents agreed to it?

522
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,003
Yes.

523
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,505
Are you sure?

524
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,715
Yes.

525
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,926
They support me.

526
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,887
Okay then, let's go.

527
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,725
You can wash the car.

528
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:29,311
Want me to drive?

529
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:33,023
I drive for 47 summers.

530
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,150
Are you sure?

531
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:36,693
Absolute.

532
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,737
Get in the car, useless.

533
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,948
Come on.
- Sorry. Sorry.

534
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:18,861
In the city where the man
fully controls its environment...

535
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:22,614
I find it easy to believe that he is all.

536
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:25,033
But here, where accept the things...

537
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,244
As nature intended and not as we want...

538
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,413
Is liberating.

539
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,623
In a way, the pressure decreased...

540
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:34,626
Because I discovered that
it was not so important.

541
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,421
accept the idea that a higher power...

542
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:40,966
Had a plan for me made me resign.

543
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:49,057
Everywhere I looked,
through paintings.

544
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:51,894
Masterpieces passed in my mind.

545
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,438
I was saddened by Nicholi.

546
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:57,733
For his life's work
not be considered important.

547
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,985
Did not understand how
the supposed experts...

548
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,779
Could say something so ignorant.

549
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:06,575
About Them gave this power?
Or, more importantly, that right?

550
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,119
Like beauty could be irrelevant?

551
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,205
A landscape that disappeared
before our eyes...

552
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:13,957
With increasing approach of man...

553
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:17,628
Was the most irrelevant possible for me.

554
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:42,736
Is a pause.
Need to pee.

555
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,056
Put?? things in my bed.

556
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,433
Upstairs.

557
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,311
Okay.
Where do I put my stuff?

558
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:20,148
barn. Joke.
In the first room on the right.

559
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,898
Comfortable, no?

560
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:03,066
Yes, it is.

561
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:06,528
Is not it beautiful?

562
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,780
This place...

563
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:11,116
Reminds me a little Rome.

564
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,035
Really?
- Yes.

565
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,245
And Russia is so?

566
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:17,956
St. Petersburg...

567
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,460
Baltic Sea...

568
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,213
My boy...

569
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,590
Are beautiful.

570
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:28,217
I grew up...

571
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,929
And studied English, German, Russian.

572
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,227
Lindo.

573
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:40,437
This place.

574
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,065
Yes, beautiful.

575
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,652
After the German attack...

576
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,405
There was little reason to stay.

577
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:54,618
I was stopped at the border
by a young German soldier...

578
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,578
Should have their age.

579
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:59,331
He asked me where I was going.

580
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:04,545
I said I was leaving my country...

581
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:07,005
He had invaded.

582
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:09,675
And I wanted to be free.

583
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:14,096
And that if he did not,
could shoot me.

584
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,557
But I would not stop walking.

585
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:17,891
Continued walking...

586
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,393
Walking...

587
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:21,895
Walk and walk.

588
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:26,191
And he did not shoot.

589
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:28,902
Was brave.

590
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,654
No, no.

591
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,865
I was not brave.

592
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:36,201
I was just too tired to care.

593
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:40,038
I'm half German.

594
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:42,249
Not going to shoot me?

595
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,877
Play.

596
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:48,672
Perhaps the soldiers have rabies.

597
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,555
Feels homesick?

598
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,726
I do not think much of it.

599
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:03,228
Can not go back.

600
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,688
If you could, again?

601
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,023
No.

602
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,025
I'm an American now.

603
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:11,653
I love my adopted country.

604
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,280
Really?

605
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:15,699
Of course it does.
Do not you?

606
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:16,909
I think so.

607
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:18,160
Your worthless.

608
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,496
You have no idea what's in here.

609
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,080
In any other country...

610
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,833
Would be in the gutter,
that is your place.

611
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:27,669
Calm. Did not mean it.

612
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,005
I am very happy.

613
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:34,760
I'm happy to be American.

614
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:38,597
I am very happy to be with you Why.

615
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:42,059
I am very happy for being American.

616
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,229
I am very happy to be with you Why.

617
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:53,862
Why am I a bastard
a Russian Impressionist painter...

618
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:58,116
'll be a bastard of a painter.

619
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:01,036
American impressionist Russian.

620
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,380
You're hopeless.

621
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,592
Way no.

622
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:44,121
Beautiful, no?

623
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,542
Without any noise.

624
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:28,457
One thing that did not diminish
in my life was the fear.

625
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,460
I began to realize that
was in the middle of nowhere with this guy.

626
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,837
Maybe my father was right?

627
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:37,049
Maybe this old wanted to attack me.

628
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,554
I came to see if you are comfortable.

629
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:26,265
Yes.

630
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,185
Yes.

631
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,105
Good night.

632
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,274
Okay.

633
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:52,374
I've never seen a human eat as much as
Seroff.

634
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,214
He?? began eating half a
dozen eggs in the morning.

635
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,176
A pound of bacon and at
least six slices of toast...

636
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:06,722
With butter and marmalade
and four cups of coffee.

637
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:14,605
This followed by tablets
to pressure, heart...

638
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,149
And something that decreased blood sugar.

639
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,943
And last but not least...

640
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,696
He?? took a large dose of vodka...

641
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:26,074
What he did also the rest of the day.

642
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,592
Today you will paint.

643
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:20,838
Where is he?

644
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:41,525
What is this?

645
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:43,235
I liked.

646
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,445
Smells mother.

647
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:47,364
I liked.

648
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,575
How are you, my friend?

649
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:54,663
Curtis am Sunday.

650
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,249
It's good to see you.
Very good.

651
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,959
You are great.
- Is that for me?

652
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:02,129
Yes To remember the old days.

653
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:05,424
Something to show me?
- Yes...

654
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:08,051
Come on.
- Yes.

655
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:31,658
The exhibition was not as I expected.

656
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,827
I do not know...

657
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:37,581
Feel there is a great boredom.

658
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,750
People want to be shocked.

659
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:44,463
They want to panic,
want to be caught in discomfort.

660
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:47,007
're Talking about art?

661
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:50,427
Is a moron.

662
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,596
Well..

663
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:56,475
I was invited to join the
committee of art next month.

664
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,770
I'm also on the organizing
committee and would like...

665
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:00,896
...juror.

666
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,147
Are you interested?

667
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:04,483
There will be painting or crap?

668
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:07,694
Progressive Art.
- So, it's crap.

669
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:08,987
Nicholi,

670
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:12,699
with its classic style and
his eye for what is true...

671
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:14,868
Do me a favor.

672
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:17,454
Sure, sure.

673
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,748
I will, if you can laugh.

674
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:22,459
Good.

675
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,801
So...

676
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,386
Knew the exhibition at the Tate?

677
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:33,971
No.

678
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:37,766
My God.
Are junk hanging on the walls.

679
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:39,017
Mean...

680
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:41,645
Trash framed.

681
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:43,146
They did it on purpose?

682
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,815
I'm intrigued and you?

683
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,860
I am intrigued to know who paid to see.

684
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:50,070
And our young friend?

685
00:42:50,154 --> 00:42:51,613
Is my guest.

686
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,866
He is interested in art?

687
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:56,618
Yes, wants to be a painter.

688
00:42:57,828 --> 00:43:00,205
In old-fashioned or progressive?

689
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:04,001
Progressive or Classic?

690
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,586
It needs a label?

691
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:08,338
Yes, we tag,
to facilitate discussion.

692
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:10,799
Do not mean to be rude...

693
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:13,677
But do not know if I can label.

694
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,263
Please. Try.

695
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:18,140
Do you hear the rain?

696
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:19,808
She hits the roof...

697
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:21,310
Window...

698
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,520
There is thunder...

699
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:25,522
I think about it.

700
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:27,691
Is a moment...

701
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:30,152
Only exists now.

702
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,863
Once it exists,
is the memory.

703
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:38,118
Encounter peace about it.
I like to catch these things.

704
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:39,995
Do not like to paint a picture...

705
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:43,207
Which is painted only by the image.

706
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:45,918
Sorry...

707
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:47,336
This make sense?

708
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:48,504
Yes.

709
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:51,465
Sharing experiences makes sense.

710
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:54,593
But it is representative, right?

711
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,013
I think so.

712
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:00,224
I'm curious.

713
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:04,144
What prevents to break it?

714
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:06,438
Is fear?

715
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:07,856
Fear of what?

716
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,900
From deepen?

717
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,694
Sorry,
I do not know what you mean.

718
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:14,905
The representative is safe.

719
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:17,074
Safe?
How did this?

720
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:18,617
Uses symbols.

721
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,162
Whenever we use a brush,
create symbols.

722
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:25,541
Well, it's true.

723
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:29,795
Without saying that art representative
is seriously undervalued now.

724
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,673
Is far from safe,
not you think?

725
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:42,182
My God, you do not exist.

726
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:02,327
What do you think?

727
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:08,375
Need to arrange the wallpaper of the room.

728
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,546
Express something important. So here is.

729
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:16,049
Come on.

730
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,403
Think we're done.

731
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:40,365
Do not get up, okay.

732
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:46,538
My goodness.

733
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,374
What is?
I'm not ugly.

734
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:52,920
No, it was not what I meant.

735
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,547
I understood.

736
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,925
Nicholi is?

737
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,141
I'll leave it here.

738
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:09,978
If you want, I can wake him.

739
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:11,230
No.

740
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:13,398
Do not need to do this.

741
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,654
I'll make coffee.
- Okay.

742
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,450
So...

743
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:25,702
Is the handyman?

744
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,830
No.

745
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:30,040
Not?

746
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,126
So, who are you?

747
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:36,880
I am an artist.

748
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,383
Is an artist?
- Yes...

749
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:45,180
...not seem so sure.

750
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:47,349
Yes, I am.

751
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:49,643
Must be talented.

752
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:52,312
Nicholi does not accept students of art.

753
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:54,022
Well..

754
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:56,817
Now I'm just tidying up.

755
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:59,278
So, is the handyman.

756
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,240
No.

757
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:05,409
I heard voices.

758
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,580
Nicholi.
- Hello.

759
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:13,542
Good to see it.

760
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,086
Place the bed in place.

761
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:21,592
Let me see it.

762
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:23,844
Wonderful.

763
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,470
Linda.

764
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:27,264
I'm old.

765
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:29,600
Thanks for that.
- Sure.

766
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:31,810
Apple.

767
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,022
'Put the bed in place.

768
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:37,274
I am Russian.
Look at me.

769
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:41,236
Mando in young people.
I'm great.'

770
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:48,368
Then reduce this.

771
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:51,622
This?

772
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:53,457
Show me another.

773
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,626
I like this.

774
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:59,171
But I'm a girl, Nicholi.
- I know.

775
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:01,548
You know?
- Yes.

776
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,676
What?

777
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,888
Nothing.
- Need something now?

778
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:13,769
Show...
- But if you do...

779
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:16,730
Think your house will look very feminine.

780
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:18,649
Do not you think?
- I do not know.

781
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,818
I dirty.

782
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:23,570
And this?

783
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:31,328
Thank you.

784
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:34,164
The apple pie was delicious.

785
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:36,333
More next week.

786
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:39,336
Thank you.

787
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:44,007
Pleasure to meet you, John.
- Thank you and goodbye.

788
00:48:49,555 --> 00:48:51,640
It is quite a woman.

789
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:56,270
She is beautiful and amazing.

790
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,440
Women are wonderful
creatures, are not they?

791
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:05,529
To be honest,
not have much experience with them.

792
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:08,073
You...

793
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:10,701
Do not be mad, we...

794
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:13,245
Only we understand.

795
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:19,001
Share an experience.
- I guess you can say that.

796
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:22,546
She lost a son.

797
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:25,215
A drunken idiot...

798
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:27,593
Trod.

799
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:31,430
She reminds me of my Anya.

800
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:34,433
My Anya.

801
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:39,313
She was beautiful and intelligent.

802
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:44,818
Not so clever, because married me.

803
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:49,740
She was a teacher at the same
university where I taught...

804
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:51,658
...painting.

805
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:53,827
What happened?

806
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,584
She died.

807
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,548
It is quite simple, chose a woman
because we think she's perfect.

808
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,717
And they choose us...

809
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,095
Because they want to make us perfect.

810
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:18,352
At twenty-somethings...

811
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:22,022
'll Remember what I said...

812
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:24,900
Nod and think: 'That crazy.'

813
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,486
At thirty-somethings...

814
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:30,948
Will remember a few words.

815
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:35,118
At 50...

816
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:39,540
Will say: 'That bastard Russian...

817
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:43,043
...was right about a lot.'

818
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:47,756
Keep laughing, idiot.

819
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:07,442
Enough of that.
We'll see.

820
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:10,070
Sunday nights were important to Seroff.

821
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:13,699
He began to cook dinner morning.

822
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,013
There termites here.

823
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:40,142
The dinner seemed to last for hours.

824
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:43,687
Nicholi and Curtis sat, drank...

825
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,899
And spoke about the same thing
arguing for years.

826
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:50,152
There is a place for...

827
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,779
A representative art.

828
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:57,659
there is a place for old school...

829
00:51:57,784 --> 00:52:01,497
Whatever teaching methods
conventional learning...

830
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,165
For the new school.

831
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:04,458
But only...

832
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:07,794
For reasons of documentation,
historical reasons...

833
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,422
To show how the art was...

834
00:52:10,547 --> 00:52:12,925
As opposed to what it will be.

835
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,259
That sucks.

836
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:16,386
Sorry, Sandra.
- Do not worry, Nicholi.

837
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,722
After so many years already
gotten used to you two.

838
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:21,558
And you? What do you think?

839
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:24,520
Well..

840
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:27,773
He understands the modern movement
more than me.

841
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:28,816
Well..

842
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:32,194
She likes,
in an intrinsic level, but...

843
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,613
Let's be honest,
she graduated in Psychology...

844
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:36,698
And not in Art History.
You know that, Nicholi.

845
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:38,325
I think is crazy.

846
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,660
What, my friend?

847
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:43,580
What needs to be trained to appreciate art.

848
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:47,125
I mean, it's like
need a degree to enjoy music.

849
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:51,296
The art is no longer what it was
a means of communication to the masses...

850
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,592
For what is now a medium to select.

851
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:57,469
And what does this have to do?

852
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:01,473
Are you a member of the masses, as it
and the farmer down the street.

853
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,934
The farmer down the street...

854
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:06,520
Have very different interests from ours.

855
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:09,439
But art is a common denominator.

856
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:12,442
When you, Sandra,
John, I...

857
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,570
And the farmer down the street...

858
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,989
We pause for a moment...

859
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:20,951
And appreciate something
that connects us all...

860
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:24,496
The beauty of being alive...

861
00:53:24,663 --> 00:53:26,748
This art.

862
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,626
The art divide us, not art.

863
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,421
You are very sentimental, Nicholi.

864
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:36,091
Speaks of sentimentality like a disease.

865
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:38,177
I say something funny.

866
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:40,929
What's the problem sentimentality?

867
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:42,723
No place in art.

868
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:45,934
Who said?
- Please Nicholi.

869
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,564
Sentimentality is a way
to express yourself...

870
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:52,441
Mediocre, mellow...

871
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:55,277
Indicating a lack of intellect.

872
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:56,278
Bullshit.

873
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,655
You're so intellectual...

874
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:01,366
Who became stupid, Curtis.

875
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,204
Feeling is condescending...

876
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,080
Is a human being...

877
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:08,499
Is knowing that life...

878
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:10,000
Is short.

879
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,503
A lot of short.

880
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:14,171
I know at my age.

881
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:16,381
If it is feeling.

882
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:19,343
I'm proud of that.

883
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:22,095
It's what you did...

884
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:25,140
I find very disturbing.

885
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,518
Cry...

886
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:29,728
Hurt, imagine...

887
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:31,021
Laugh...

888
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:33,899
Laugh even something...

889
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:38,654
Is a building block of our humanity.

890
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:40,948
Is what builds bridges.

891
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:44,535
Great Rembrandt, Van Gogh...

892
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,745
Monet, Renoir.

893
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:51,834
You talk of unrest, disorder...

894
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:55,420
Chaos, bloody chaos.

895
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,131
Sorry.
- Alright.

896
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:00,968
I'm talking about a sector
completely different...

897
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:02,302
...of the human condition.

898
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:04,972
But that has no place in art.

899
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:07,766
And the man from the ghetto, Nicholi.

900
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,145
Where is the beauty of its existence?

901
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,397
You know the ghetto...

902
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:17,109
Far as i know construct a rocket.

903
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:21,905
There must be beauty in the ghetto.

904
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:24,491
Many geniuses...

905
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:27,452
Born in the ghetto.

906
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:29,997
Need seek beauty there...

907
00:55:30,122 --> 00:55:32,416
With people who come from there.

908
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:33,542
Not a...

909
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:36,378
...rich asshole who does not know
anything about the ghetto...

910
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:39,089
That says 'wretched ghetto.

911
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:41,717
I feel your pain, I know everything.

912
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:44,511
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.'

913
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:46,889
Do you know what this is?

914
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:48,515
Is bullshit.

915
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,684
Is fucking bullshit.

916
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:57,357
Sorry.

917
00:55:57,483 --> 00:55:59,568
Okay.

918
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:04,990
Thanks, Nicholi, for one more night
wonderful and stimulating.

919
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:06,200
Alright, Curtis.

920
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:09,119
We will solve the problems
of the world next time.

921
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:11,455
Combined, friend.
- Right.

922
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:14,124
Good night, beautiful Sandra.
- Thank you.

923
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,293
Good night.

924
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:19,546
Good night.

925
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:33,644
Damn idiot.

926
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:39,900
COUNTY ART FAIR...

927
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:43,737
...knew it would not do so hot.
Heat in August?

928
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:46,198
I hope that does not affect attendance.
- Yes.

929
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:49,576
Here is the man of the moment,
Nicholi Seroff.

930
00:56:49,701 --> 00:56:52,579
Please know our friend and hostess...

931
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:54,331
Miss. Sally Huntington-Quail.

932
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:57,584
It is an honor to have him as a juror
in our exhibition, Mr. Seroff.

933
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:00,420
My pleasure.
Nicholi, please.

934
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:04,174
Hello, lovely Sandra.
- Hello, Nicholi.

935
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:05,217
Can I?

936
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:08,345
Yes, you are just waiting,
Nicholi.

937
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:27,072

- Yes.

939
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:30,909
Is it yours?

940
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:33,078
Yes.

941
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:36,665
What is the purpose?

942
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,675
Wheels mechanized.

943
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:49,928
Managed to more or less.

944
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:59,146
Lord accepts wine?

945
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:02,441
Under the table.

946
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:05,235
Here. Ready.

947
00:58:06,487 --> 00:58:08,906
You can keep the bottle.
- Thank you.

948
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:11,116
Welcome.

949
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:31,345
Is the artist?

950
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,555
Yes.

951
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:35,224
What do you mean?

952
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:38,268
I explore the two-dimensionality of the site.

953
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,437
Mean, your plan.

954
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:41,438
Yes.

955
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:44,066
It is flat, there is to explore?

956
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,985
The goal is to explore the plan.

957
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:49,446
I'm lost.

958
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,698
You know...

959
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:53,534
Is a trip that I made.

960
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:54,701
A journey?

961
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:58,747
Yes exploration of what it already is.

962
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:00,082
The plan?

963
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:02,125
Yes.

964
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,002
So...

965
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:05,504
Goes where?

966
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:07,089
I explore it.

967
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:09,091
What is now?

968
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:11,301
Yes.

969
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:13,303
Got it?

970
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:15,514
No.

971
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:21,770
PEACE.

972
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,523
My God.

973
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:29,903
See Nicholi this room was like seeing
Marilyn Monroe in a freak show.

974
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:34,074
How was outnumbered,
she had become a stranger.

975
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:38,328
Do you want anything?

976
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:41,331
A gallon of gasoline and matches.

977
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,750
Nicholi, having fun?

978
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:46,086
Amusing me?

979
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:48,380
Amusing me?

980
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:51,300
Yes, I'm having fun.

981
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,013
You know...

982
00:59:56,138 --> 00:59:59,933
If I live another ten years...

983
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,312
I see a bucket full of urine...

984
01:00:03,479 --> 01:00:05,898
The modern art museum.
Please help me.

985
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:07,858
Yes, let's go home. Let.

986
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:09,735
Nicholi.

987
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:12,362
These people are crazy.

988
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:14,740
Crazy.

989
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:16,909
E...

990
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:19,995
This crap too.

991
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:22,080
It's all crap.

992
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:24,249
People.

993
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:26,418
You see crap.

994
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,836
It's all crap.
- Come on.

995
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,297
Crap. Crap.

996
01:00:30,506 --> 01:00:34,635
Is an exhibition of madness and insanity.

997
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,180
And the madness is winning.

998
01:00:38,305 --> 01:00:40,724
Madness is winning.
- Come on.

999
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,936
This is the only thing...
- Come on.

1000
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:48,357
The only thing that makes sense here.

1001
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,361
Ready.

1002
01:00:54,112 --> 01:00:56,198
Congratulations.

1003
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:19,471
What is this?

1004
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:20,681
I do not know anymore.

1005
01:01:20,806 --> 01:01:23,475
I tried to paint the house.
I do not want the tree...

1006
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,060
Change the perspective.

1007
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:27,146
What was your first thought?

1008
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:29,022
I do not know.

1009
01:01:29,148 --> 01:01:32,317
If you do not know, how will I know?

1010
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:34,903
What do you say?

1011
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:37,656
I had a good idea, but the lost.

1012
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:38,907
No.

1013
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:40,909
not had a good idea.

1014
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,704
A good idea is not lost.

1015
01:01:45,581 --> 01:01:49,751
Monet paint this house
with a bucket of manure.

1016
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,172
He stood beside a wagon and painted.

1017
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:57,134
I want you to pay close attention.

1018
01:01:57,301 --> 01:02:00,637
Never forget what I tell her.

1019
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:03,056
Okay.
- Never Forget.

1020
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:11,648
Not understand anything.
Only is making noise.

1021
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:14,193
How not speak clearly...

1022
01:02:14,776 --> 01:02:16,862
Not say anything.

1023
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,989
E is the same...

1024
01:02:19,031 --> 01:02:21,533
With the crap that produces.

1025
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:24,828
Only...

1026
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:27,039
Have an idea.

1027
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:31,460
My companion arrived.

1028
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:34,463
Can you do a favor?

1029
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:37,841
Do not yell at me in front of her?

1030
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:40,177
Sure, you can leave.

1031
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,178
Hello.

1032
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:42,596
Carla.

1033
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,806
Brownies.

1034
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,685
What are you doing?

1035
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:51,230
Learning to speak clearly.

1036
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:59,029
Is interesting.

1037
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:02,199
I was not speaking clearly.

1038
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:05,369
Okay...

1039
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:08,121
I have to learn.
- How are you?

1040
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:10,457
Idiot.
What are you doing?

1041
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:15,003
Nicholi
taught art therapy at a local school...

1042
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,214
For special children.

1043
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:22,177
It was nice to see that side of him.

1044
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:24,680
The gentle man he could be.

1045
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:28,100
And he seemed like a lot.

1046
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:29,601
The...

1047
01:03:29,685 --> 01:03:32,646
...school teachers said that
Seroff was the favorite guest.

1048
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:34,815
Put more water.
- Okay.

1049
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,191
More water.

1050
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,235
Yes, anyway.

1051
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,404
Try.

1052
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:44,575
Put?? more strength in the face.

1053
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:46,827
And here in birds.

1054
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:16,815
My goodness.

1055
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:20,527
These children make
more sense to me than.

1056
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:21,778
Curtis Sunday.

1057
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:23,947
You know...

1058
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:26,158
Guess...

1059
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,702
Is ready to paint.

1060
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,546
It's beautiful.

1061
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:22,840
Thank you.

1062
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:24,925
Take.

1063
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:27,094
If you get thirsty.

1064
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:30,264
Thank you.
Thanks again.

1065
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:24,526
Hi, I want to thank and return your glass.

1066
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:26,695
Thank you.

1067
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,866
Are you okay?

1068
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:37,206
Was not convincing.

1069
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,125
Are you sure?

1070
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,089
I'm just having a bad day.

1071
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:48,467
Well..

1072
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,969
I want the anime a bit?

1073
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:54,848
When I'm having a bad day,
like hot chocolate...

1074
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:57,017
And chat with a friend.

1075
01:06:57,601 --> 01:06:59,978
Want some hot chocolate?

1076
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:03,315
I have time,
can not paint now.

1077
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,526
The clouds are moving.

1078
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,908
I'm making her feel better?

1079
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:19,456
Yes...

1080
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,043
...is.

1081
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:28,173
If you...

1082
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:30,801
Want to talk about something...

1083
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:32,970
Can talk.

1084
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:36,056
No.

1085
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,475
It's nothing.

1086
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:42,479
I'll talk a bit.

1087
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:46,316
Seroff Why is so boring?

1088
01:07:46,692 --> 01:07:49,820
Is always in a bad mood,
drinking.

1089
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:52,698
I think he hates me.

1090
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,035
If he hated...

1091
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:59,496
You know.

1092
01:07:59,705 --> 01:08:03,250
're Telling me is the coolest he can be?

1093
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:09,840
He told him about his wife?

1094
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:11,550
Well..

1095
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:13,719
A bit.

1096
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:17,347
He told how she died?

1097
01:08:18,348 --> 01:08:20,434
No.

1098
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:23,896
She was killed...

1099
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:25,939
In Russia...

1100
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:30,444
During the occupation of Stalin
in something they call...

1101
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:32,654
Of the Great Purge.

1102
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:36,658
He was the only family escape.

1103
01:08:39,036 --> 01:08:41,121
This kind of guilt...

1104
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:43,916
Never leaves him.

1105
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:51,840
But if you think about it,
he did nothing wrong.

1106
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:53,967
Of course we did.

1107
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:57,596
He survived.

1108
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:15,197
Take.

1109
01:09:15,322 --> 01:09:18,242
Help me cut vegetables.

1110
01:09:19,243 --> 01:09:21,328
Why up so early?

1111
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:25,415
Today will be busy.

1112
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,335
Happy?

1113
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:29,878
Demonstrates is how?

1114
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:32,506
Cut smaller pieces.

1115
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:34,716
Okay.

1116
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:40,180
You are happy, are not you?
- Yes, why not?

1117
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:42,349
A man can not be happy?

1118
01:09:50,941 --> 01:09:54,778
Young Johnny is doing very well in school.

1119
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,739
What wonder, Nicholi and John.

1120
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,660
But and the work that was promised?

1121
01:10:02,077 --> 01:10:03,120
Is anxious, is not it?

1122
01:10:03,245 --> 01:10:05,497
Yeah.
- Well..

1123
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:07,875
I'll get.

1124
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:11,044
I'll get.
- How about dinner?

1125
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,255
Like this?
- Yes.

1126
01:10:13,338 --> 01:10:14,631
Here.

1127
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:17,301
's Progressive art.

1128
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,388
Not my specialty, so I want to hear...

1129
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:23,849
What you have to say.

1130
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,352
This one.

1131
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:28,604
My goodness.

1132
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:30,272
Do not like...

1133
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,441
Shut up.

1134
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:34,276
You know...

1135
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,611
Think so.

1136
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:37,821
Yes, it is.

1137
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:40,824
So, what do you think?

1138
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:53,545
What do you think, darling?

1139
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:55,714
Not my specialty, dear.

1140
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:59,635
We know this, but can say what you think.

1141
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,428
I think I will continue as a psychologist.

1142
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:03,680
Please take a position.

1143
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:05,974
Depth E?

1144
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,939
Right, has depth.

1145
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:14,107
Depth?

1146
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:16,276
Is super deep.

1147
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:18,862
Yes, it is super deep.

1148
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,865
My God.

1149
01:11:22,908 --> 01:11:24,993
Let me see the next.

1150
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:29,706
Yes.

1151
01:11:29,832 --> 01:11:31,917
My God.

1152
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:35,629
My God, there's so much pain.

1153
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:38,882
Pain?
- The angularity...

1154
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:41,051
Yes
- Das lines.

1155
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:44,930
E despair.
A great sense of despair.

1156
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:46,223
Yes.

1157
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:48,142
E craving.

1158
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:49,685
A lot of eagerness.

1159
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:52,563
Lust, yes.
- And a sadness.

1160
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:57,609
Sadness and anger.

1161
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:02,573
Is a yin and yang emotional.
Do not you think, dear?

1162
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:05,701
Absolutely.
- Must see this, Nicholi.

1163
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:08,078
You see the sadness.

1164
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:11,999
Yes, I think it's very sad.

1165
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:14,793
I was impressed.

1166
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,504
I need to know this artist.
This is...

1167
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:20,340
More, I want to see more.
- Yes.

1168
01:12:21,758 --> 01:12:24,344
This. Like this.

1169
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:28,432
It is as if there were different styles
work here.

1170
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:33,437
If you do not know, I would say
that there is more of a hand...

1171
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:34,688
...working, but...

1172
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:37,900
But there is a predominant theme.

1173
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,736
Is...

1174
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:43,405
Is a passive impression...

1175
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,574
I would say...

1176
01:12:48,452 --> 01:12:49,828
Aimlessness.

1177
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:51,205
Yes.

1178
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:52,331
Lack of goal.

1179
01:12:52,456 --> 01:12:55,417
The artist expresses himself...

1180
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:58,253
By minimalist.

1181
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:01,256
created by the essential simplicity.

1182
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:05,135
This has weight, focal
point, secondary ideas...

1183
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:08,430
Is totally coherent.
E is purposeful.

1184
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:10,891
And see it all...

1185
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:14,394
On two blue squares...

1186
01:13:14,728 --> 01:13:17,022
And a coconut?
- It is impossible not to see.

1187
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:19,233
It's so obvious.

1188
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:22,820
Yes.

1189
01:13:22,903 --> 01:13:24,488
It's so obvious.

1190
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:27,407
'll Tell you what is so obvious.

1191
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:30,577
Is that you only talk nonsense.

1192
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,454
Please Nicholi.

1193
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:34,915
As you said it is not their specialty.

1194
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:38,335
This art is great and I think you're jealous.

1195
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,628
These frames...

1196
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:44,299
Special children are at
school in which I teach.

1197
01:13:49,555 --> 01:13:51,223
What?

1198
01:13:51,306 --> 01:13:54,101
Genius, simplicity, longing.

1199
01:13:54,184 --> 01:13:56,270
All this is bullshit.

1200
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:58,480
Bullshit.

1201
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:00,232
Nicholi, this is not funny.

1202
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:02,693
I think it's hilarious.

1203
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:04,611
You know what, I will not be for coffee.

1204
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:06,488
No, please stay...

1205
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:10,075
And see the wonderful picture of a red car
. Have anxiety.

1206
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,994
Grab your stuff.
Come on, honey.

1207
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:14,955
Curtis, I have a wonderful picture of a dog.

1208
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,125
What do you think? Is not it beautiful.
- Enough.

1209
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,960
Is a beautiful picture.

1210
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:24,923
Is a work of art two mice oranges.

1211
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,510
You know, Nicholi,
you really mad.

1212
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,847
I'm crazy.
I'm crazy.

1213
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:33,849
What's so funny?

1214
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:36,018
I'm crazy.

1215
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:39,688
I'm crazy.
I'm crazy.

1216
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:43,984
You can stop laughing?
- I freaked.

1217
01:14:44,151 --> 01:14:47,738
I'm crazy.
I'm crazy.

1218
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,948
I'm crazy.

1219
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,463
Yes, yes.

1220
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,507
Good day.

1221
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:08,675
Yes.

1222
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,471
What?
What?

1223
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:16,934
I came to see if you
could teach me to paint.

1224
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:18,769
What?

1225
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:20,938
Paint?

1226
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:22,773
Yes.

1227
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:25,025
Paint what you want.

1228
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:55,055
Wasps found in the attic.

1229
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,223
Good.

1230
01:15:56,348 --> 01:15:58,100
Why not go for a ride?

1231
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:00,811
I'm here for two hours and finally
'm getting something.

1232
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:03,772
The sun moved in two hours.

1233
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:05,774
I know said.

1234
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:07,860
But I want to finish painting.

1235
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:09,611
Go take care of wasps.

1236
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:11,196
Why do not you do it?

1237
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:14,867
Do not think I'm too old to climb the ladder
?

1238
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:18,162
Do not climb the ladder
and say how good it is.

1239
01:16:18,245 --> 01:16:21,290
What did you say, useless?
- You heard me.

1240
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:24,042
Agreed that I would come and
you would teach me to paint...

1241
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:25,502
I did not come to fix your home.

1242
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:29,089
And the story that his
father did not understand?

1243
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:31,049
What do you know about my father?

1244
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:35,012
What I know about it?
He?? thinks I'm a gay old man.

1245
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:36,680
You should know.

1246
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,766
He just wants chicken...

1247
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:42,394
Chicken, chicken.

1248
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:44,855
Just know you've been drinking.

1249
01:16:44,938 --> 01:16:47,191
Want a lesson today?

1250
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:49,526
I will show Him.

1251
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:51,820
The sky is off.

1252
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:54,990
Everything reflects the sky.

1253
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:57,034
Here, look.

1254
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:58,744
I'll put here.
- What?

1255
01:16:58,827 --> 01:17:01,205
At all.
- What is it?

1256
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:03,415
Okay.

1257
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:06,043
Thank you.

1258
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,878
Must be improved.

1259
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,129
Fuck.

1260
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:10,297
What I damned?

1261
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:14,134
Yes, damn it, Nicholi.
- What would you like to eat for dinner?

1262
01:17:14,218 --> 01:17:16,303
What about fish?

1263
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,722
I'm tired of meat.

1264
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:24,728
Wasps are waiting.

1265
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:30,150
Must be joking.

1266
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,541
Come on, wake up.

1267
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,335
Wake up, come on.

1268
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,756
Come on, I'm hungry.

1269
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:06,436
Come on.

1270
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:08,772
Open.

1271
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,947
My goodness.

1272
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,657
The sky is falling.
- Really?

1273
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,450
Yes, it is...
- I can tell.

1274
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:23,829
Started when I was in
the middle of the field.

1275
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:25,455
Want a towel?

1276
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:28,375
Would be nice.
- You can take it.

1277
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:32,671
Yes, sorry.
I'm wetting everything.

1278
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:42,306
Paint...

1279
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:46,018
Is what you want to do?
Want to live it?

1280
01:18:49,813 --> 01:18:53,108
I do not know.
Never thought about it...

1281
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:56,195
As a way to earn money,
understand?

1282
01:18:56,528 --> 01:18:59,948
I know I love doing this,
I feel passion...

1283
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:03,076
Only talking about it get excited.

1284
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:08,874
There is a place in New York called
Grand Central Art Galleries.

1285
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:12,794
I go up there and spend
hours looking at those...

1286
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,505
...beautiful.

1287
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:16,673
I see...

1288
01:19:16,757 --> 01:19:20,886
And literally feel my heart beat faster.

1289
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:25,933
I do not know how they manage.

1290
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:31,355
If we 5cm Frame see only strokes...

1291
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:33,607
Ink and color.

1292
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:37,319
E...

1293
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:39,071
...30 away...

1294
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:41,573
We see a gorgeous frame.

1295
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:47,621
It is as if we felt the wind
blowing through the trees...

1296
01:19:47,746 --> 01:19:49,832
A sea breeze...

1297
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,836
Wow.

1298
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,880
Is...

1299
01:19:57,047 --> 01:20:00,676
I do not know how they manage to do this.

1300
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,265
I know something inside me, somewhere...

1301
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,143
Struggle to leave.

1302
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:14,982
You'll get.

1303
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:17,151
I do not know.

1304
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:19,611
I like a lot.

1305
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:22,447
There are other things I like to do.

1306
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:26,243
Storytelling,
make people laugh...

1307
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,036
Love music.

1308
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,205
Do you play anything?

1309
01:20:30,581 --> 01:20:32,666
Yes, guitar and sax.

1310
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:38,380
Then is a true Renaissance man.

1311
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:42,634
I do not know, maybe.

1312
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:47,806
Looks like you're apologizing.

1313
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:53,145
Things are tough at home, is not it?

1314
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:03,697
The whatever is going on there...

1315
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:06,617
Not worry...

1316
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:10,954
You'll be fine.

1317
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:17,294
Thank you.

1318
01:21:25,177 --> 01:21:28,806
Nicholi told me what happened to her son.

1319
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:31,558
I wonder...

1320
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,436
If someone took care of him.

1321
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,605
Nicholi?

1322
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:42,653
Something.

1323
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:47,074
And her husband?

1324
01:21:47,866 --> 01:21:50,452
I've never been married.

1325
01:21:51,203 --> 01:21:53,288
Only got pregnant.

1326
01:21:54,665 --> 01:21:56,750
The father around?

1327
01:22:02,172 --> 01:22:04,258
Listen...

1328
01:22:06,135 --> 01:22:08,345
I know you feel guilty...

1329
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,389
But should not.

1330
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:13,350
Not done anything wrong.

1331
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:24,862
You are very kind, John.

1332
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:32,286
Do not let anyone make you
give up what you want to do...

1333
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:34,246
...

1334
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:36,456
Who want to be.

1335
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:44,464
Follow your heart.

1336
01:23:14,286 --> 01:23:16,371
Thank you.

1337
01:23:31,804 --> 01:23:33,889
You are beautiful.

1338
01:23:36,308 --> 01:23:38,393
Thank you.

1339
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:05,087
I tried to wake him, was...

1340
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:08,257
Overturned.

1341
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:20,144
I better...

1342
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:23,147
Take it home.

1343
01:24:30,904 --> 01:24:32,990
Good night, Nicholi.

1344
01:24:33,365 --> 01:24:35,242
Good night...

1345
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:37,452
Carla.

1346
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:51,633
So...

1347
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:55,637
I...

1348
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,890
Enter or...

1349
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:00,476
Go?

1350
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:03,687
I love...

1351
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:06,190
But...
- Go away.

1352
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:11,195
I understand.

1353
01:25:41,099 --> 01:25:43,185
Thank you.

1354
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:15,968
Well..

1355
01:26:16,135 --> 01:26:18,220
You...

1356
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:22,015
She is my friend.

1357
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:24,268
My friend.

1358
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:26,436
Not yours.

1359
01:26:28,897 --> 01:26:30,315
I'm sorry.

1360
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:31,942
I bet you do.

1361
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:34,278
You are right, not sorry.

1362
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:36,446
I want you to go away.

1363
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:37,948
Okay.

1364
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:40,159
Come into my life...

1365
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:43,537
And turned upside down...

1366
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:45,873
As if it was nothing.

1367
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:47,249
How dare you?

1368
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:49,459
You lied to me.

1369
01:26:49,543 --> 01:26:51,628
Do not lie.

1370
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,965
I was helping...

1371
01:26:55,215 --> 01:26:57,301
But is too young...

1372
01:26:57,509 --> 01:26:59,595
Too stupid...

1373
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:04,224
To see the gifts that I gave you.

1374
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:07,436
Everyone present.

1375
01:27:11,273 --> 01:27:14,526
I want to go away tonight.

1376
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:18,197
I will,
and you go back to your bottle.

1377
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,073
Feel sorry for yourself.

1378
01:27:20,157 --> 01:27:22,075
You do not understand.

1379
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,244
Not understand.

1380
01:27:24,828 --> 01:27:27,581
I'm at the end of life...

1381
01:27:28,248 --> 01:27:30,751
And only see...

1382
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:33,253
A bad life...

1383
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,255
Front of me.

1384
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,966
I'm early in my life and I see the same thing.

1385
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:40,844
You had the world in his hands.

1386
01:27:40,928 --> 01:27:43,013
For five minutes.

1387
01:27:43,597 --> 01:27:45,891
Do not know if I'm good, I know nothing.

1388
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:47,643
I do not know to go home.

1389
01:27:47,726 --> 01:27:49,812
I do not care.

1390
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:52,105
No one cares.

1391
01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:57,569
Is what I was trying to tell her...

1392
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:59,905
All the time.

1393
01:28:04,409 --> 01:28:07,538
The world is very ugly.

1394
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:12,751
E killed...

1395
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:25,472
The most beautiful thing...

1396
01:28:25,848 --> 01:28:28,267
I've ever seen...

1397
01:28:28,767 --> 01:28:30,853
My Anya.

1398
01:28:35,858 --> 01:28:37,943
My goodness.

1399
01:28:41,029 --> 01:28:43,532
She was so happy.

1400
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:52,124
I remember her laughter.

1401
01:28:56,086 --> 01:28:58,172
Because...

1402
01:28:58,755 --> 01:29:03,260
She would never part of his ugliness...

1403
01:29:04,928 --> 01:29:07,014
Took her from me.

1404
01:29:22,654 --> 01:29:24,865
Knew you had something...

1405
01:29:25,949 --> 01:29:29,077
Even before seeing his paintings...

1406
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:36,293
Before appearing at my door, remember?

1407
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,589
But you...

1408
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:44,510
Would be crazy to become a painter
nowadays.

1409
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,929
No heroes.

1410
01:29:47,012 --> 01:29:50,724
No Van Gogh,
Rembrandt, Monet...

1411
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:53,685
Renoir no, nothing.

1412
01:29:55,646 --> 01:29:58,023
Expected it to be my hero.

1413
01:30:04,655 --> 01:30:06,740
I'm tired.

1414
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:09,034
I am very...

1415
01:30:09,117 --> 01:30:11,203
Tired.

1416
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:55,455
Nicholi?

1417
01:30:55,956 --> 01:30:59,376
Come, let us take breakfast.

1418
01:31:05,174 --> 01:31:07,259
Nicholi?

1419
01:31:13,348 --> 01:31:15,434
My goodness.

1420
01:31:17,561 --> 01:31:19,646
Gotcha.

1421
01:31:21,231 --> 01:31:23,317
You idiot.

1422
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:29,406
Today we paint.

1423
01:31:32,242 --> 01:31:34,328
Not funny.

1424
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:42,794
We went to the field that morning...

1425
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,755
And it seemed another person.

1426
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,965
His palette...

1427
01:31:47,174 --> 01:31:49,593
Should always be the same.

1428
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:53,931
Your colors are like the keys of a piano.

1429
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:57,518
Musicians need to be always
in the same place...

1430
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:59,228
To express themselves.

1431
01:31:59,353 --> 01:32:01,897
The great painters do the same thing.

1432
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,899
He showed me a lot.

1433
01:32:04,024 --> 01:32:06,193
He flooded me knowledge.

1434
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,488
A life of secrets ran like a river.

1435
01:32:09,655 --> 01:32:11,615
The sun is like a woman...

1436
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:14,493
When he kisses her warm lips...

1437
01:32:16,411 --> 01:32:19,248
It leaves a little color everywhere.

1438
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:23,418
I began to see yellows,
ochres, oranges and reds...

1439
01:32:23,544 --> 01:32:24,545
...everywhere.

1440
01:32:24,628 --> 01:32:29,383
And the forest is hot but calm.
The opposite of war.

1441
01:32:29,633 --> 01:32:32,261
Not only about the color temperature...

1442
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:35,764
But it is the opposite on the color.

1443
01:32:38,058 --> 01:32:41,061
The forest has yellow and purple.

1444
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:44,064
The grass is green everywhere.

1445
01:32:44,273 --> 01:32:46,775
Where the light passes, is pink.

1446
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:48,944
Got it?

1447
01:32:50,154 --> 01:32:52,614
It was amazing what he could do.

1448
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:55,242
In a few seconds he turned
something simple...

1449
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:57,452
On something alive.

1450
01:32:57,661 --> 01:32:59,746
Must fight...

1451
01:32:59,997 --> 01:33:03,792
Must make way to give life to things.

1452
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:07,254
You must feel the joy.

1453
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:11,258
He?? showed me how to
make the sky vibrate.

1454
01:33:12,426 --> 01:33:13,760
Bravo, John.

1455
01:33:13,886 --> 01:33:15,345
Bravo.

1456
01:33:15,429 --> 01:33:17,514
This is life.

1457
01:33:18,098 --> 01:33:19,850
I feel the shadows.

1458
01:33:19,975 --> 01:33:23,479
I feel the sun approaching.

1459
01:33:24,104 --> 01:33:26,773
The joy of it all.

1460
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:30,944
Bravo, John.

1461
01:33:35,157 --> 01:33:36,950
I have to thank you...

1462
01:33:37,034 --> 01:33:39,369
The time he spent with me.

1463
01:33:40,454 --> 01:33:42,539
I is that I thank him.

1464
01:33:42,748 --> 01:33:45,876
No, you showed me something...

1465
01:33:46,376 --> 01:33:48,796
I thought I would not see.

1466
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,257
Thanks, Nicholi.

1467
01:33:52,382 --> 01:33:54,468
Thank you.

1468
01:34:08,565 --> 01:34:10,067
Better...

1469
01:34:10,192 --> 01:34:12,236
Say goodbye to his girlfriend.

1470
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:14,238
Do not you think?

1471
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:16,824
She's not my girlfriend, Nicholi.

1472
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:20,911
Leave a note,
a beautiful letter or something.

1473
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:22,955
Great, great.

1474
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,165
I'll wait here.

1475
01:34:55,821 --> 01:34:57,656
Dear Carla...

1476
01:34:57,781 --> 01:34:59,449
You were right...

1477
01:34:59,533 --> 01:35:01,618
I was lost.

1478
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:06,456
But finding my way was
very sweet and rewarding.

1479
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:09,209
His words always accompany me.

1480
01:35:10,169 --> 01:35:12,045
Find your dreams too.

1481
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:13,755
With Love...

1482
01:35:13,839 --> 01:35:15,924
John.

1483
01:36:01,094 --> 01:36:03,055
've Put your bags upstairs.

1484
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:05,265
Thank you.

1485
01:36:06,058 --> 01:36:08,143
Whither?

1486
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:11,855
I do not know.

1487
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:14,024
I have to solve.

1488
01:36:16,151 --> 01:36:18,237
Good luck.

1489
01:36:58,235 --> 01:37:00,904
I went to the park and drew for hours...

1490
01:37:00,988 --> 01:37:04,283
Rehearsing what to say to my parents.

1491
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:08,829
Finally, I thought
would be better to face them...

1492
01:37:08,912 --> 01:37:12,040
And let fate take care of the rest.

1493
01:37:37,483 --> 01:37:38,400
Health.

1494
01:37:38,525 --> 01:37:40,611
'Dastrovia'.
- 'Dastrovia'.

1495
01:37:40,694 --> 01:37:42,529
I enjoyed myself.

1496
01:37:42,613 --> 01:37:44,823
Good,
I'm glad to hear that.

1497
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:47,242
We were talking about you.

1498
01:37:47,743 --> 01:37:49,953
Your friend Nicholi is a good man.

1499
01:37:50,037 --> 01:37:51,205
It is.

1500
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:55,209
He?? was telling me how
to have a good time.

1501
01:37:58,086 --> 01:38:00,672
Glad you're back.
- Thank you.

1502
01:38:04,468 --> 01:38:06,553
Heard you met a girl.

1503
01:38:07,054 --> 01:38:08,138
Yes - Is it true?

1504
01:38:08,222 --> 01:38:10,307
Yes...

1505
01:38:11,058 --> 01:38:13,018
Want a drink?
- Please.

1506
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:14,186
Come on.
- Yes.

1507
01:38:14,269 --> 01:38:16,355
Come.

1508
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,898
It's good to see you.

1509
01:38:18,023 --> 01:38:19,775
Honey?

1510
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,276
Good...

1511
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,487
Your teacher...

1512
01:38:23,946 --> 01:38:26,031
Came to see his father.

1513
01:38:28,742 --> 01:38:30,911
Learned something?

1514
01:38:31,745 --> 01:38:33,455
Yes, mother.

1515
01:38:33,539 --> 01:38:35,624
A lot.

1516
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,127
Good.

1517
01:38:38,252 --> 01:38:40,337
It is very good.

1518
01:38:42,798 --> 01:38:47,010
I still do not know what
Nicholi said to fix things.

1519
01:38:47,094 --> 01:38:49,179
But no matter.

1520
01:38:49,304 --> 01:38:54,601
My father and I never
talked about what happened that summer.

1521
01:39:01,942 --> 01:39:04,027
Never went to college.

1522
01:39:04,403 --> 01:39:06,989
Chose to study in the museum.

1523
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:10,784
Especially art.

1524
01:39:11,827 --> 01:39:14,913
But there are other things in life.

1525
01:39:21,837 --> 01:39:24,339
Not helping.
- I can not fix.

1526
01:39:24,465 --> 01:39:27,301
I'm terrible at this.
- A little.

1527
01:39:27,509 --> 01:39:30,471
I understand a bit,
but can not get it from here.

1528
01:39:30,596 --> 01:39:31,597
So.

1529
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,975
It is the artist.
He?? should do this.

1530
01:39:35,058 --> 01:39:38,645
Where are you going?
- I'll take this one for Nicholi.

1531
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,647
You said you'd help me to clear the entry.

1532
01:39:40,772 --> 01:39:43,692
And I will.
I do it when I return.

1533
01:39:47,404 --> 01:39:49,156
Okay.

1534
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:50,407
Take care.

1535
01:39:50,532 --> 01:39:54,244
There is a lot of ice on the road.
Drive carefully.

1536
01:39:54,328 --> 01:39:56,413
Okay.

1537
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:58,457
Okay.

1538
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,334
See his mother.

1539
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:02,503
See how she looks.

1540
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,338
Look at you.

1541
01:40:04,421 --> 01:40:06,507
You are beautiful.

1542
01:40:07,049 --> 01:40:09,134
Dear.

1543
01:40:25,025 --> 01:40:27,110
Nicholi?

1544
01:40:28,821 --> 01:40:30,906
Nicholi?

1545
01:40:54,221 --> 01:40:56,306
Nicholi?

1546
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:00,561
's How I like to remember it.

1547
01:41:00,644 --> 01:41:03,564
Your brush dancing on the screen...

1548
01:41:03,647 --> 01:41:06,650
Like a ballerina dancing on stage.

1549
01:41:10,904 --> 01:41:15,075
I would say that Nicholi
lived many more years.

1550
01:41:15,367 --> 01:41:20,247
That I had given him a gift
or a reminder of what he had been.

1551
01:41:20,372 --> 01:41:23,459
But I think it would be
very presumptuous of me...

1552
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:25,294
.

1553
01:41:25,419 --> 01:41:27,880
And perhaps a lie.

1554
01:41:39,224 --> 01:41:41,518
Nicholi died that spring.

1555
01:41:45,981 --> 01:41:49,026
A part of me died with him.

1556
01:41:51,361 --> 01:41:54,364
I stopped painting for many years.

1557
01:42:02,414 --> 01:42:06,043
FOR JOHN.

1558
01:42:08,003 --> 01:42:10,422
FOR JOHN.

1559
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,803
Heard he left the house for Carla.

1560
01:42:15,886 --> 01:42:17,429
She had designed most of it...

1561
01:42:17,513 --> 01:42:21,350
And I think we both knew it would end like.

1562
01:42:29,191 --> 01:42:33,445
Other interests have led
me to the west coast...

1563
01:42:35,906 --> 01:42:37,991
But as he grew older...

1564
01:42:38,283 --> 01:42:41,829
More ideas Nicholi returned to guide me.

1565
01:42:42,204 --> 01:42:44,748
And all the gifts he gave me.

1566
01:42:48,168 --> 01:42:50,754
Still see men as trees.

1567
01:42:54,967 --> 01:42:58,595
How naked people dancing on the hillside.

1568
01:43:01,306 --> 01:43:05,018
Clouds are everywhere
in where angels soar.

1569
01:43:07,521 --> 01:43:11,108
It took me years to realize
that Nicholi had died...

1570
01:43:11,191 --> 01:43:14,903
But the whole time he was here,
living inside me.

1571
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:18,657
Waiting patiently me to share my journey.

1572
01:43:19,950 --> 01:43:22,161
But most important for me...

1573
01:43:22,244 --> 01:43:25,622
Kept his promise long...

1574
01:43:27,416 --> 01:43:31,211
's Heart Nicholi would be my home...

1575
01:43:31,587 --> 01:43:33,881
Everyday of my life.

1576
01:43:47,603 --> 01:43:49,855
IN 1991 JOHN TALIA MADE
HIS FIRST EXPOSURE.

1577
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:52,608
THE GRAND CENTRAL ART
GALLERIES IN NEW YORK.

1578
01:43:52,733 --> 01:43:56,945
SAME GALLERY representing
Nicholi Seroff.

1579
01:43:59,323 --> 01:44:02,743
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED TO THE
REMEMBRANCE OF GEORGE Cherepov.

1580
01:44:02,826 --> 01:44:05,496
AURIELLO YAMMERINO ARTHUR J. Ornitz.

1581
01:44:05,621 --> 01:44:09,958
THREE MEN WHOSE LOVE AND PATIENCE
CHANGED MY LIFE.

1582
01:47:12,432 --> 01:47:18,355
MASTER OF LIFE.
